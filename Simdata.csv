Of course, everybody knows this. However, when I ask simulation colleagues about their latest modeling, they invariably tell me about a computer program (their <U+0093>model,<U+0094> a noun). This usually involves showing me an animation or plots of some experiments run with their code. Considering simulation modeling as a disciplined, structured method of communicating, with the simu- lation code as secondary or even superfluous, has broadened my perspective about simulation. This has changed the way I teach, practice, and do research on simulation. In the classroom, the mandatory simulation term project has become a term product. Changing that single word has made a huge difference. Understanding different objectives and perspectives, and designing strategies for communicating these, are more the focus than writing computer codes. Students have received an A in my class without ever successfully debugging a single simulation code, but by producing well-designed, well-communicated products. Several of these term products have later become commercial successes.

In my simulation practice, often the most valuable part of a project has been running a series of <U+0093>Turing tests<U+0094> where people try to distinguish simulated (or totally fake) output from real system data. It is not unusual for correct arguments to lead to incorrect conclusions, and everyone learns something of value about each other and about themselves. A current research project involves an extensive system of data bases that models itself. This self-simulating informa- tion system is designed to be current and credible, and used primarily for communication within a major teaching hospital. The medical information system can only tell what happened in the past, but the embedded ever-changing self-simulation can explore what might happen in the future. There is no distinct simulation model, nor model building team involved. To model well, is it necessary, or good, that everyone, or anyone, agree on the validity of the same simula- tion? Do we even need to code and run a computer program for a simulation project to be a success, and provide great value?"

Since a majority of the service systems are labor-intensive, the main resources are the service workers. Designing such service systems is nontrivial due to a large number of parameters and variations, but crucial for business decisions such as labor staffing. The most important design point of a service system is how and when service requests are assigned to service workers a.k.a. dispatching policy. This paper presents a framework for evaluation of dispatching policies in service systems. A discrete event simulation model of a service system in the data center management domain is presented. We evaluate four dispatching policies on five real-life service systems. We observe that the simulation-based approach incorporates intricacies of service systems and allows comparative analysis of dispatching policies leading to more accurate decisions on labor staffing."

Over the past decade lean thinking has emerged as an approach for improving healthcare systems.  Although lean is meeting with some success in the healthcare environment, sustaining its implementation is a key challenge.

Given that simulation and lean have a similar motivation, to improve processes, this work provides a methodology for bringing simulation and lean together in a healthcare environment.  <U+0091>SimLean Healthcare<U+0092> aims to improve the implementation of simulation and the sustainability of lean.  At the centre of this approach is the rapid use of simulation in lean workshops."

In contrast to related work on genetic algorithms (GAs) for similar problems, the representation used in HGGA is based on a variable number of batches.

To help improve and facilitate the molding of plastic parts, advanced computer simulation tools have been developed. While modeling is complicated by itself, the difficulty of optimizing the injection molding process is that the performance measures involving the process usually show conflicting behaviors. Therefore the best solution for one performance measure is usually not the best for other performance measures. This paper introduces a simulation optimization method that considers multiple performance measures and is able to find a set of efficient solutions without having to evaluate a large number of simulations. The main components of the method are metamodeling and design of experiments. The method is illustrated and detailed here using a simple test example.

We demonstrate that the presence and size of the time step as a modeling component can have a substantial impact on the basic characteristics of agent and simulation performance.

Interest management schemes developed for distributed simulation systems such as those based on HLA can be applied to mobile systems. These schemes can be classified into area-based and cell-based mechanisms. Sort-based schemes have been proposed and shown to yield good performance. When using sort-based schemes in mobile peer-to-peer systems, questions such as the design of the sorting mechanism and where to perform the sorting and matching process must be addressed. This paper proposes an interest management mechanism for mobile peer-to-peer systems, that divides the entire space into cells and uses a bucket sort to sort the regions in each cell. A mobile landmarking scheme is presented to implement this sort-based scheme in mobile peer-to-peer systems.. The new mechanism is expected to have better computational efficiency for both static matching and dynamic matching. Experimental results indicate that this approach yields better performance than several alternate interest management schemes."

They are often used to approximate computationally expensive simulation code in order to speed up the exploration of design spaces. A crucial step in the building of surrogate models is finding a good set hyperparameters, which determine the behavior of the model. This is especially important when dealing with sparse data, as the models are in that case more prone to overfitting. Cross-validation is often used to optimize the hyperparameters of surrogate models, however it is computationally expensive and can still lead to overfitting or other erratic model behavior. This paper introduces a new auxiliary measure for the optimization of the hyperparameters of surrogate models which, when used in conjunction with a cheap accuracy measure, is fast and effective at avoiding unexplained model behavior."

Serious interactive business game; Automobile Supply Chain Management Game (AUSUM) has been introduced in this paper. It simulates the material and information flow through the different supply chain entities. Using theories learnt in class as a knowledge base, participants have to develop effective supply chain partnership strategy to enhance their supply chain networks. Deploying the game over the web encourages student interaction and group work. Most importantly the game will enable students to fundamentally grasp the impact of strategic decisions on other parts and players of the supply chain network."

We model this problem in a Bayesian context, where the decision-maker's preferences are described by a utility function, but this utility function is unknown to the analyst. The analyst must choose how to allocate his simulation budget among the alternatives in the face of uncertainty about both the alternatives' attributes, and the decision-maker's preferences. Only after simulation is complete are the decision-maker's preferences revealed.  In this context, we calculate the value of sampling information contained in simulation samples, and propose a new multi-attribute ranking and selection procedure based on this value.  This procedure is able to incorporate prior information about the decision-maker's preferences to improve sampling efficiency."

We propose a new simulation allocation procedure that is risk-neutral with respect to simulation outcomes, but risk-averse with respect to the implementation decision. We discuss the properties of the procedure and present numerical examples illustrating the difference between the risk-averse problem and the more typical risk-neutral problem from the literature."

We demonstrate that even in settings where the patient population and services provided are fixed, models that do not account for natural variations in the arrival rate and correlation in patient lengths of stay in sequential units will show the same utilization, but underestimate congestion  and the resulting costs.  Therefore, we argue that utilization is an inappropriate measure for validating models and congestion metrics such as blocking and diversions should be used instead."

George Box's famous assessment that ""all models are wrong, some are useful"" referred to statistical models, but should now be re-imagined to reflect that some (indeed, many) simulation models are ""right enough"" to aid in decision making for important practical problems.  Over the past 50 years, simulation has transformed from its beginnings as a brute force numerical integration method into an attractive and sophisticated option for decision makers.  This is due in part to the exponential growth of computing power.  Although other analysis approaches also benefit from this trend, keyword searches of several scholarly search engines reveal that the reliance on simulation is increasing more rapidly. A simple analysis paints a compelling picture:  simulation may well be becoming a researcher's ""first resort,"" as well as a preferred method for decision makers."

Processed items are sampled and inspected, considering inspection rate and response time, in order to minimize OOC rate at a given capacity. The inspection operating curve is established for demonstrating the tradeoff between OOC rate and inspection capacity. It exhibits that OOC decreases at a reduced rate with increasing capacity. Fab specific financials can provide the cost ratio between capacity and OOC for determining the preferred working point on the inspection operating curve."

As the feature size of semiconductor devices continuously shrinks down, the problem induced by greedy-search-oriented TCA algorithm becomes severer because the total number of tools is getting large and product yield loss is more likely caused by a specific tool combination.

As a result, the velocity of the charge carrier is significantly overestimated and conventional Monte Carlo estimators have very high variances. We reduce the number of simulation steps that are spent in the low energy problem regions by using a coarsenened state space model, where the problem regions (identified by a stochastic watershed algorithm) are treated as single states.  This results in significantly better performing estimators."

A fundamental stability requirement for an irreducible SPN is that the markings of the net be recurrent, in that the marking process visits each marking infinitely often with probability 1. We study recurrence properties of irreducible non-Markovian SPNs with finite marking set. Our focus is on the ""clocks"" that govern the transition firings, and we consider SPNs in which zero, one, or at least two simultaneously-enabled transitions can have very heavy-tailed clock-setting distributions. We establish positive recurrence, null recurrence, and, perhaps surprisingly, possible transience of markings for these respective regimes. The transience result stands in strong contrast to Markovian or semi-Markovian SPNs, where irreducibility and finiteness of the marking set guarantee positive recurrence."

An aggregated-level model runs in normal conditions, where each crosswalk is represented as an agent. A derived probability function extended from Adams<U+0092> model is utilized to estimate an average pedestrian delay with corresponding traffic flow rate and traffic light control at each crosswalk. When an abnormality is detected, a detailed-level model with each pedestrian being an agent is executed in the affected subareas. Pedestrian decision-making under abnormal conditions, physical movement, and crowd congestion are explicitly considered in the detailed-level model. In addition, pedestrian-driver interactions under unsignalized condition such as midblock crossing have been modeled as a two-player Pareto game. By mimicking cognitive decision making processes of drivers and pedestrians, we intend to identify the significant variables that help improve comfort and convenience as well as safety of pedestrian crossing."

Petri nets (PNS) are a formalism which allows a precise representation of the intricacy of modern systems and thus of the interactions among different system components characterized by internal complex functionalities with a very well defined semantics. In this paper we will discuss the properties of PNs that are useful for a preliminary qualitative validation  of the model and we will show how the PN representation can be easily exploited to gain a reasonable confidence about the correctness of the model.

Our approach, which combines simulation with heuristics, considers different potential inventory policies for each customer, computes their associated inventory costs according to the expected demand in the period, and then estimates the marginal routing savings associated with each customer-policy entity. That way, for each customer it is possible to rank each inventory policy by estimating its total costs, i.e., both inventory and routing costs. Finally, a multi-start process is used to iteratively construct a set of promising solutions for the IRP.

AR time series are employed for modeling variations in parameters that happen at a time scale different from the corresponding to process cycle execution. Three basic configurations are analyzed: serial line, assembly process and a disassembly process. A case study from the natural slate tiles industry is presented showing the differences obtained in simulation results between a model in which independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumptions are adopted and one in which autocorrelation effects are considered."

An optimization process is built upon this network structure enabling an improvement to system performance of the AMHS prior to commonly employed dynamic simulations. This approach is a mere static one as it neglects dynamic behavior. However, run time is magnitudes faster than of dynamic simulations. Thus, it provides improvements not achievable in a feasible way before. These may later be analyzed and validated in simulations. The achievements of this method could be demonstrated in a case study of a running semiconductor Fab.

In order to analyze and propose these inventory policies, a discrete event simulation model was created using the simulation software Arena 12.0. The model replicates the activities that are performed along the chain including donation arrivals, testing, production, inventory management and dispatching. Twelve scenarios were analyzed, each one representing different inventory policies composed of a combination of optimum inventory level, and reorder point. The best results are obtained when 7 days of inventory is considered as optimum level with a reorder point of 6 days. The simulation of this scenario shows that it is possible to decrease unsatisfied demand and wastage of red cell units in a 2.5% and 3% respectively in comparison to the current situation."

The development of the model is complicated by the fact that there are different categories of patients (with different time-varying arrival rates, treatments and procedures), and the data records were incomplete to allow direct estimation of many of the key operational parameters (e.g. the duration of doctors' consultation). To tackle the first issue, patients' arrivals are modelled as Poisson processes with category and time-dependent arrival rates. The second issue is resolved by positing a general distribution (Weibull) for some key processes, and developing meta-heuristic approaches to jointly estimate the distribution parameters.

To resolve this concern, we suggest that specifying agent-based models formally will resolve the problems of incrementality and flexibility of the agent-based models through an organized composition of model components. To organize the composition of agent-based models, we survey formalisms that are applicable to agent-based models, including formalisms from the discrete event models, i.e., DEVS, MDEVS, and Cell-DEVS, as well as formalisms used in the communi-ties of agent-based models, i.e., BDI, MDP, and Game Theory.

In reality, besides the fresh calls (initial call attempts), there are many redials (re-attempts after abandonments) and reconnects (re-attempts after answered calls) in call centers. Neglecting redials and reconnects will inevitably lead to inaccurate forecasts, which eventually leads to inaccurate staffing decisions. However, most of the call center data sets do not have customer-identity information, which makes it difficult to identify how many calls are fresh.
Motivated by this, the goal of this paper is to estimate the number of fresh calls, and the redial and reconnect probabilities. To this end, we propose a model to estimate these three variables.

Three approaches, a Branch and Bound-linear programming hybrid, a stochastic search algorithm-linear programming hybrid, and a pure random search are developed and tested in simulated environments.

A simulation model is used to capture the dynamics and uncertainties of the system and evaluate the system performance. Three split policies, LOS-policy, LDD-policy and LWT-policy are designed to implement the order split/consolidation. To optimize the route of orders in a consolidation, a genetic algorithm is developed and integrated with the simulation model. Experimental results showed that the average order size has significant impact on consolidation and split policies. Split delivery outperforms non-split delivery significantly when the average or-der size occupies about 60% of a truckload. Large arrival rate of orders also benefits split delivery. Sparse distribu-tion of customers deteriorates the performance of split delivery. In various experimental scenarios, LDD-policy is always better than LOS-policy and LWT-policy."

This paper presents a novel technique based on maximizing flow through a network where nodes are black-box model units.  This network-based method is less sensitive to problem size, the computation effort required to solve the mass balance is proportional to O(m+n) instead of O(mn) with the simplex algorithm.

REDSim focuses on quantifying the impacts of staff decision processes, such as patient selection, on the length of stay, waiting and boarding times, and other variables. We show REDSim<U+0092>s effectiveness by running a small study comparing four patient selection strategies: longest waiting, shortest distance, random, and highest acuity. REDSim showed that although patient length of stay is not significantly reduced (1.4%) the throughput increases 17% when providers select the closest instead of the highest acuity patient for the next task."

Based on the U.S. hospital data, we find that the size distribution is sub-lognormal (a leptokurtic distribution more skewed than normal but less skewed than lognormal), which is different from those of firms and cities. We develop an agent-based simulation model to simulate the preference behavior of patients and the service processes of hospitals. The model can produce a sub-lognormal size distribution similar to the U.S. hospital size distribution. Sensitivity analysis shows that the patients<U+0092> preference behavior and search distance are two key factors for the emergence of the sub-lognormal size distribution."

Organisations that implemented Kanban-Like Production Control Strategies (PCS) especially in a multi-product manufacturing environment (MPME) plan a large volume of production authorisation cards (PAC) to respond to demand variability. The issue associated with high PAC for each part-type in a MPME is proliferation of WIP. 
Shared Kanban Allocation Policy (S-KAP) was recently proposed in literature to allow various part-types to share PAC. An advantages of this, is that when there is a corresponding shift in demand within part-types in a MPME, the system quickly responds by allocating PAC accordingly to part-types without recourse to re-planning/re-scheduling of PAC.
This paper is aimed to investigate the performance of a newly developed Basestock-Kanban-CONWIP (BK-CONWIP) Control Strategy in a four-product-five-stage manufacturing system with erratic demand.

SPOQ performs virtual sensor placement optimization by means of making queries to the photon map generated by the photon mapping algorithm and uses this query output as input to a prevailing modified sensor placement algorithm. Since SPOQ uses photon mapping, SPOQ can take into account static or dynamic simulated environmental conditions and can use exploratory or precomputed sensing. The SPOQ method is computationally efficient, requiring less memory than other sensor placement solutions."

However, for most online simulation applications, the capability of a simulation approach to respond to system dynamics is at least as important as the performance in steady-state analysis. Hence, this paper focuses on the prediction accuracy of the ad hoc approach in open queueing networks with short-term system-state transients. We empirically demonstrate that, with slight modification to the prior ad hoc approach for steady-state studies, system dynamics can be modeled appropriately. Furthermore, a potential livelock issue that arises with the modification is addressed."

For a product-based sampling decision limited to a particular station in a production segment, the randomness of the departure process and the merging of different product flows at the machines of the different stations subvert the regularity of deterministic sampling. The risk of not regularly monitoring any machine in the segment can be measured in terms of maximum number of consecutive unsampled items.

The objective is to identify lots that can skip the inspection operation, i.e. lots that have limited impact on the risk level of process tools. The risk considered in this paper, called Wafer at Risk (W@R), is the number of wafers processed on a process tool between two defect inspection operations. An indicator (GSI, Global Sampling Indicator) is used to evaluate the overallW@R and another associated indicator (LSI, Lot Scheduling Indicator) is used to identify the impact on the overall risk if a lot is not measured. Based on these indicators, five new algorithms are proposed and tested with industrial instances. Results show the relevance of our approach and that evaluating sets
of lots for skipping performs better than evaluating lots individually."

Although formulations with fractional lead times have been proposed by Hackman and Leachman (1989), we are not aware of any studies that systematically evaluate the benefits of using fractional lead times in LP models. In this paper we implement LP models to plan the releases of wafers into a large-scale wafer fabrication facility and compare the performance of LP models with and without fractional lead times by simulating the execution of the resulting release plans.

This work studies factors contributing to production variability, and evaluates the variability's influence on CT. It relies on queueing networks, CT and variability approximations, operational curve modeling, and common practice. It demonstrates that increasing variability drives longer CT at a growing pace, and has a larger effect on CT than utilization. Growing machine inventory weakens the impact of utilization on CT and almost eliminates it at high inventory, while the impact of variability on CT remains significant. Decline of machine availability prolongs CT at a growing pace, and is affected by variability more than utilization. Overall the primary factor of production variability is attributed to machine availability, and specifically to repair time. Reducing variability for achieving decreased CT is less costly and more effective than reducing machine utilization or increasing capacity."

3) Lack of affordable modeling tools and expertise. Many tools cost thousands of dollars and require simulation experts to spend weeks on customer sites.
We developed Print Production Designer (PPD) to attack the aforementioned challenges. Powered by a custom factory dynamics simulation engine based on UC Berkeley<U+0092>s Ptolemy toolkit  and deployed as a cloud service, PPD brings quantitative trade-offs to light, optimizes customers<U+0092> information, and helps them to reach the right printing press purchasing decision. A typical PPD run costs $5.28 which is affordable for even small-sized PSPs."

More flexibility and creativity to represent social phenomena (an adequate mix of model scope, resolution, and fidelity) is desirable. The representation of social phenomena with a combination of different methods seems intuitively appealing, but the usefulness of this approach is questionable. Current view on the justification of multi-method has limitations in social science context, because it lacks a human dimension.
This paper explores the literature that pertains to mixing methods, and displays current reasoning behind the use of the multi-method approach. The perspective on mixing methods from empirical social science projected onto M&S domain exposes high-level purposes related to representation of social phenomena with mixed method approaches. Based on the reviewed literature and qualitative analysis, the general view of ingredients for inferring purposefulness of the multi-method approach in the context of social phenomena representation is proposed."

The objective is to identify lots that can skip the inspection operation, i.e. lots that have limited impact on the risk level of process tools. The risk considered in this paper, called Wafer at Risk (W@R), is the number of wafers processed on a process tool between two defect inspection operations. An indicator (GSI, Global Sampling Indicator) is used to evaluate the overall W@R and another associated indicator (LSI, Lot Scheduling Indicator) is used to identify the impact on the overall risk if a lot is not measured. Based on these indicators, five new algorithms are proposed and tested with industrial instances. Results show the relevance of our approach and that evaluating sets
of lots for skipping performs better than evaluating lots individually."

This research proposes the integration of 3D laser scanning into a traditional simulation project methodology in order to aid decision-making. Some promising stages for integration have been identified based on a technology demonstrator in the aerospace industry."

The proposed method applies rank-one update to efficiently build RBF models and derives a closed form for the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) error of RBF models, allowing an adaptive choice of radial basis functions. In addition, we develop an estimated error bound, which shares several desired properties with the kriging variance. This error estimate motivates us to design a novel sampling criterion called weighted improvement, capable of balancing between global search and local search with a tunable parameter. Computational results on 45 popular test problems indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several benchmark algorithms. Results also suggest that multiquadrics introduces lowest LOOCV error for small sample size while thin plate splines and inverse multiquadrics shows lower LOOCV error for large sample size."

From solving the mystery of dark energy to string theory, our entire philosophy depends on the unknown physics at the electroweak scale. The hunt for the elusive Higgs boson has gone on for almost half a century.  Its discovery was finally announced on July 4, 2012. The discovery of the Higgs boson is even more significant than often discussed. This grand experimental achievement in the largest, most powerful machine ever built, the Large Hadron Collider, marks a far wider scientific, philosophical and intellectual triumph  and one that spans human history from the dawn of civilization. It has to do with the idea of symmetry: amazingly, the Higgs boson was predicted to exist not for any physical reasons, but on strictly mathematical grounds based on arcane symmetries usually studied in ""pure"" mathematics. And the search for these symmetries involves a major quest that began with the Babylonians and Egyptians and continued to the ancient Greeks, the Arabs, medieval Europe, and on through the 19th century to our own time.  This talk will begin with a brief overview of particle physics and why the Higgs Boson is so important and how it completes the symmetry. It will then explain how one goes about searching for this particle and expand the critical role simulation efforts played not only in the final analysis but also in designing the detector systems, which truly are modern marvels. I will discuss with some other highlights from these experiments and what to expect as the LHC gears up to come back on line in early 2015 at its design energy, nearly double its current 8 GeV operating point.

The first four topics dealing with defining project objectives, understanding the system, creating a functional specification, and managing the project are often given inadequate attention by beginning modelers. The latter sections dealing with building, verifying, validating, and presenting the model offer some insight into some proven approaches."

The interaction over time of many components often leads to emergent behavior, which can be harmful to the system. Despite this, very few practical approaches for the identification of emergent behavior exist, and many are unfeasible to implement. Approaches using interaction as a measure of emergence have the potential to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we analyse absolute and relative methods that use interaction as a measure of emergence.  Absolute methods compute a degree of interaction that characterizes a system state as being emergent. Relative methods compare interaction graphs of the system state with interaction graphs of systems that have been shown previously to exhibit emergence. We present these approaches and discuss their advantages and limitations using theoretical and experimental analysis."

It is clear that incidents of this nature result in economic loss, but their side effects are much more profound: since there is no record of missed sales opportunities, the estimated demand curve tends to be inaccurate. As a result, order placement strategies employed by retailers are based on imprecise forecast models, so further out-of-shelf events are very likely to occur: a vicious cycle, hence, arises. In this work, we propose a multi-agent-based simulation to evaluate the impact of out-of-shelf events that considers the reactions of customers towards these incidents and retailers ordering strategies. Our results show that these events have a significant effect on demand estimation and that multi-agent-based simulations may provide interesting insights and support for the development of more accurate forecast models in retail."

This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based methodology, together with agent-based crowd simulation, to solve the evacuation planning problem. The proposed method features a novel segmentation strategy which divides the entire evacuation region into sub-regions based on a discriminant function. Each sub-region is assigned with an exit gate, and individuals in a sub-region will run toward the corresponding exit gate for evacuation.

The new method performs very well, and the two algorithms execute at similar speeds; however, CM is slower than QE if random number generation is taken into account, because CM requires more random numbers. The Radon-Nikodym derivative sometimes has a rather intriguing behavior, which is itself of interest. We propose an explanation."

Therefore, a fundamental question to answer before capturing the dependence parameter uncertainty in a stochastic system simulation is whether there is sufficient statistical evidence to represent the dependence in the presence of limited data.

Surgery groups are forced to release unscheduled OR time, which then becomes available for other groups to use. In this paper, we investigate release policies based on various surgery arrival distributions, capacity levels, and case durations. We show the tradeoffs of different policies involving assigned block and open posting rooms utilization levels and number of cases not accommodated in the schedule. Our results show that block release has a minor benefit for services with high room utilization (at or above 80%). Services with lower room utilizations may benefit from release, but one must consider whether to use block release or to reallocate the services block time."

In order to increase patients privacy and satisfaction, while restraining cost, a redesign of the existing Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) was suggested at the Mayo Clinic. A simulation model was created to determine the number of beds required in the redesign of the PACU to maintain Operating Room (OR) blocking below 5 %. Since OR time and resources are more costly than the PACU, limiting the resource scarcity of the PACU should minimize delays through the surgical suites. By assuming PACU resourcing as secondary to managing the OR, the underlying complexity of the surgical scheduling did not have to be analyzed. Real data was fed into the simulation model that successfully captured the complexity of the system without the work-intensive requirements of theoretical modeling.

We conduct experiments using the city of Galveston as an example. The evacuation framework offers insight to decision-makers about the number and location of shelters, allocation and assignment of evacuation vehicles, and distribution of relief resources that are required to complete a large-scale evacuation."

In typical simulation models, patient screening behavior is often assumed as homogeneous (patient characteristics do not influence the probability of undergoing screening) and rigid (invariant with time, and not malleable by screening interventions), and modeled as such. However, patient screening behavior in reality is heterogeneous and malleable. Disregarding these realities affect the model functionality and modeling outcomes. We propose two general simulation model structures: one representing typical existing simulation model and another representing simulation model that incorporates heterogeneity and malleability of patient screening behavior. We then illustrate both model structures by implementing it in the case of Diabetic Retinopathy eye screening. Comparison of the two resulting models indicate that heterogeneity and malleability of patient screening behavior should be addressed in simulation models to improve model functionality and precision of outcome estimates."

This takes into account the commonly known fact, that the accuracy of a model output depends on the model input. Therefore an approach for using techniques of Knowledge Discovery in Databases is introduced to derive logical relations from the data. We discuss how Knowledge Discovery would be applied, as a preprocessing step for simulation scenario setups, in order to provide benefits for the level of accuracy in simulation models."

In practice, many firms are self-financing, i.e., their ability to replenish their own inventories is directly affected not only by their current inventory levels, but also by their receivables and payables. In this paper, we analyze the materials management practices of a self-financing firm whose replenishment decisions are constrained by cash flows, which are updated periodically following purchases and sales in each period.

Towards this end, we develop an analytical model to quantify the manufacturers optimal capacity reservation quantity and realization time, as well as the suppliers optimal regular capacity. Given regular production capacity competition, a Cellular Automata (CA) simulation model is developed to resolve the analytical intractability of reservation realization time by modeling the manufacturers in an N-person game and identifying the convergence condition.

Drivers do not always use consistent methods to determine who has the right-of-way to enter the intersection at unsignalized intersections.  Problems with right-of-way assumptions include that not all drivers engage in one set algorithm to assess intersections priority, and issues of yielding can occur when drivers arrive at an intersection simultaneously or near-simultaneously. A discrete event simulation model was built to emulate a 4-way stop-signed intersection; and different prioritization rules were instated to determine which lane has right-of way.  First-in-first-out and yield-to-right prioritization methods were found to differ in terms of time spent waiting and traveling through the intersection, as well as intersection throughput for different intervals of high traffic volume.  The first-in-first-out prioritization algorithm provided superior service to drivers arriving at an intersection, compared to the traditional yield-to-right approach, in both low- and high-traffic volume conditions."

Inventory turnover is a practical performance indicator that is used to calculate the number of days for which a company retains inventory before selling a product. Although previous studies on inventory level settings have primarily applied information regarding demand variability and forecast error, few studies have investigated the inventory turnover for inventory decisions. Inventory turnover data are time scaled, suited for a small sample, and right censored to fit the input of survival analysis. In this study, a model in which inventory turnover and survival analysis were integrated was developed to estimate the production inventory survival function used to determine inventory level. Data analysis results based on real settings indicated the viability of using inventory survival analysis to determine semiconductor memory inventory level settings."

The tested devices fail mainly in a short circuit event and their physical inspection reveals cracks in the power metallization. Commonly, the time till fracture of macroscopic metal layers is modeled with S-N or e-N fields, this means that the lifetime (N) depends on the mechanical stress (S) or the strain (e), respectively. Metal layers of semiconductor devices are microscopic (=20um) and, in general, their ageing mechanisms are different than for macroscopic layers, nevertheless the application of the macroscopic based e-N model to semiconductor lifetime data shows good results.

The kernel can manage discrete-event and discrete-time hybrid simulations and run the simulation in stand-alone or distributed modes. It can also support parallel simulations. AddSIM can interoperate with legacy models in various forms, C/C++, MATLAB, HLA/RTI, and DIS, through the AddSIM external interface functions. The support services are environmental services (terrain, atmosphere, and maritime), spatial service, journaling/logging service, and utility service."

Previously, the commodities were only analyzed individually and deterministically for their launch support capability, but this study was the first to integrate them to examine the impact of their interactions on a launch campaign as well as the effects of process variability on commodity availability. The model utilized the flow process modules in Rockwell Arena to simulate the commodity flows and calculate total use.

In the 1990s a new simulation methodology, discrete rate simulation, was developed to address those issues. The most challenging aspect of discrete rate simulation is to accurately calculate the movement of material (flow) over a wide range of simulated systems. To calculate flow rates, the first generation DRS technology used an iterative algorithm based on the propagation of potential rates. The iterative approach failed to provide an accurate calculation of flow for many DRS models, limiting the use of this technology to a small range of real world problems. Discussed here is how the second generation DRS technology uses a global oversight approach to model the full range of DRS systems and resolve the issues associated with earlier methods."

With 95% likelihood, consistent positioning accuracy of 1-2 meters away from the actual position of a tracked tag can be obtained in the fabrication shop-which is deemed sufficient for materials and labor hours tracking in support of shop production control.

However, the number of possible resource assignments increases exponentially with the increase of the range of available resources. Many researchers combined Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and other optimization techniques with simulation models to reach the Pareto solutions. However, due to the large number of resources required in complex and large-scale construction projects, which results in a very large search space, and the lack of the GA capability in fast convergence to the optimum results, parallel computing is required to reduce the computational time. This paper proposes the usage of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-<U+F049><U+F049>) as the optimization engine integrated with Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to model the bridge construction processes. The parallel computing platform is applied to reduce the computation time necessary to deal with multiple objective functions and the large search space."

                                This research extends current work in model analysis and program understanding to assist modelers in obtaining more insight into their models and the systems they represent.

Risk spread so fast that bank failures resembled the dynamics of popping corn unlike a typical cascading avalanche of cause and e<U+FB00>ect. To model the systemic risk of the 2008 <U+FB01>nancial crisis, we will assume two interdependent networks, such as the banks network  and the housing market network. High correlations in the networks cause shrinking of distance between nodes/networks. It means that a small failure can be transmitted to many nodes in another network fast and easily. Thus, risk can move around between two networks, resulting in an increasingly devastating ping-pong e<U+FB00>ect. Even if a single network structure is resilient, this kind of risk can make it vulnerable. The key premise of my project is that ping-pong and cascading e<U+FB00>ects in multiple interdependent networks can explain the observed popcorn e<U+FB00>ect."

Towards this end, we develop an analytical model to quantify the manufacturers optimal capacity reservation quantities and realization times, as well as the suppliers optimal regular capacity.

I compiled a large database of decisions from a variety of repeated social dilemma experiments, developed a statistical model that predicted individual-level decisions in a held-out test dataset with 90% accuracy, and implemented the model in agent-based simulations where I apply constrained optimization techniques to designing games -- and by theoretical extension, institutions -- that maximize cooperation levels.

The three critical questions are: (i) how to design efficient and effective algorithms for making dynamic simulation model design decisions during simulation; (ii) how to map simulation entities (e.g., agents) into (real-time) tasks; and (iii) how to enable a divide and conquer approach to validating simulation models."

However, reliable and efficient communication strategies are needed to synchronize agent states across multiple processors.  Traditional management methods are conservative in nature and perform a complete synchronization of all agent state information at every time step of the simulation.  An alternative approach to traditional methods is proposed which uses an event-driven technique to synchronize agents.  This procedure only synchronizes changes to pertinent information in the model at each time step.  This technique requires less information to be broadcast which reduces the run time of the simulation while maintaining consistency in the model."

To address this gap, we developed an agent-based simulation model based on empirical communication data on energy conservation from Twitter. Using global sensitivity analysis, we explored the patterns of information diffusionand, by extension, the flow of influencein large networks, and identified the key attributes that dominate the opinion leaders influence.

One-size-fits-all risk cutoff values, such as 1/270, are commonly used in DS screening to recommend diagnostic tests. However, evidence suggests that different women have different preferences about the pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study is to find the optimal risk cutoff values for DS screening.

Multi-agent models such as MATSim (multi-agent transport simulation) have been highlighted for recent years as a solution to address these complex and microscopic simulation requirements. They are viewed as an emergent and collective behavior of agents, (i.e., vehicles). However, as the simulations scale up, their computational requirements could get increased beyond the capability of a single CPU and thus should be fulfilled with parallelization. Multithreading can partially contribute to parallelization by utilizing multi-cores, but cannot give full scalability of both CPU power and memory space.

Then, an evolutionary framework based on the Cartesian Genetic Programming algorithm and an agent-based crowd simulation model is developed to search for the optimal heuristic rule. By considering dynamic environment features to construct the heuristic rule and using multiple scenarios for training, the proposed methodology aims to find generic and efficient heuristic rules that perform well on different scenarios.

This contrasts favorably with aggregate deterministic models, which ignore variability, and  negates the requirement to assume ""convenient"" but potentially unrealistic distribution choices which aggregate stochastic models need in order to be analytically tractable.  Initial  explorations with our new model show behaviors similar to the observed course of Ebola outbreaks over the past 30+ years.  While many outbreaks will fizzle out relatively quickly, some appear to reach a critical mass threshold and can turn into widespread epidemics."

procedures (CIPs) for the mean of a steady-state time series. In 1985, overlapping batch
means (OBM) was introduced as an alternative to NBM for estimating the standard error of
the sample mean. Despite OBM's inherent efficiency, because the OBM statistic does not
approach normality via the chi-squared distribution, no OBM CIP was introduced. We define two fixed-sample-size OBM CIPs. OBM1 is based on the result that asymptotically OBM has half again as many degrees of freedom as NBM. OBM2 does the same, but increases degrees of freedom.  We argue that OBM's sampling distribution has skewness and kurtosis closer to normal than the chi-squared distribution. We show experimentally that for AR(1) processes the OBM CIPs perform better than NBM CIPs in terms of classic criteria and the VAMP1RE criterion.

In this paper we study input uncertainty when using simulation to estimate important performance measures: expectation, probability, and value-at-risk.

Burnett (The Boeing Company)","In commercial airplane manufacturing and assembly, traveled work refers to jobs which are delayed and/or completed in a factory location other than what was originally planned. Traveled work takes longer to complete in terms of labor hours, and incomplete work can interfere with operators ability to complete other planned work causing cascading delays. Reducing or eliminating traveled work is often targeted as a cost reduction measure. A system dynamics model was created to simulate the propagation of traveled work from an airplane final assembly line to final preparation for delivery. Instead of considering work at the level of fidelity of individual jobs (as in Discrete Event Simulation), jobs are aggregated into stocks with other related jobs in a top down approach. The model thus avoids DESs requirement for a complete job precedence network. Simulation results point to high-leverage policy changes which may reduce traveled work and reduce cost."

The first four topics dealing with defining project objectives, understanding the system, creating a functional specification, and managing the project are often given inadequate attention by beginning modelers. The latter sections dealing with building, verifying, validating, and presenting the model offer some insight into some proven approaches."

In order to do that, the paper introduces different scheduling restrictions and constructs a local search heuristic for scheduling the cranes. The heuristic relies on simulation to calculate the length of a given schedule, i.e., the makespan. In the numerical experiments different scheduling restrictions are compared in three different types of automated storage and retrieval systems.

Inferences from fusion must then account for uncertainties about the model, the credibility of information, and the fusion methodsi.e. we must consider both structural and parametric uncertainties, including uncertainties about the uncertainties. We use a novel combination of (1) probabilistic and parametric methods, (2) alternative models and model structures, and (3) alternative fusion methods that include nonlinear algebraic combination, variants of Bayesian inference, and a new entropy-maximizing approach.

New versions of the inverse method exploiting tables constructed outside the simulation are developed to efficiently generate both the arrival times and service times. The simulation experiments show that a rate-matching service-rate control successfully stabilizes the expected queue length, but not the expected waiting time, while a new square root service rate control, based on a assuming that a pointwise stationary approximation is appropriate, successfully stabilizes the expected waiting time when the arrival rate changes slowly compared to the expected service time."

The simulation results show that RPELM performs better than common release policy (such as FIFO and EDD) with higher on-time delivery rate, especially for that of hot lots, without sacrificing the throughput and cycle time performance."

Park (Ajou university)","Presented in this paper is a dispatching rule for engineering lots by a wafer FAB. The proposed rule uses the concept of reservation to ensure greater capacity for the engineering lots. Although a reservation based rule was previously proposed by one of the authors, it has remained difficult to ensure the necessary capacity for the engineering lots because of variations in the processing time for each step of the process. In this paper, we enhanced the previously proposed rule to reflect the fact that batch tools often cause bottlenecks because of their long processing times. We developed a FAB model using the Measurement and Improvement of Manufacturing Capacity (MIMAC) dataset 6, and performed simulations with MozArt. The simulation results clearly show the advantages of the enhanced reservation based dispatching rule over the previous version of the rule and that it is vital to identify an appropriate reservation range."

This work presents a novel approach to state saving by only storing the relative changes caused by an event. Compressing these deltas allows retaining  a greater number of non-committed events and allows Time Warp to further exploit parallelism in a window less constrained  by memory limitations. By compressing the data, we realize greater returns in performance and avoid  memory limitations on event / state sizes. Compression ratios over 200x are observed and, despite chosen pathological conditions, state restoration is fast and efficient. Runtimes are often faster using delta encoding than their conservative counterparts without the need for complex reverse code or large memory consumption."

In practice, however, ideal supply chain collaboration is difficult to achieve. In particular, a factor that is presumed to hinder collaboration is competition between firms. Even though several studies suggest that competition benefits supply chains, other studies come to the opposite conclusion. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes an agent-based modeling approach to understand how competition and collaboration between firms affects supply chains in the market in which they operate. The model represents customers, manufacturers, and suppliers collaborating and competing in a supply chain strategic space. Preliminary results presented in this paper are reported for the purpose of illustration.

The goal of the model is to allow analysis and comparison of fisher strategies and their impact on the environment under different ecological limitations, fishing policies and assumptions of rationality on the part of the fishers."

Often, this cognitive model is incredibly simple, such as choosing actions at random or based on simple conditionals.

The LevelSpace extension (Hjorth, Head & Wilensky, 2015) for NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) allows NetLogo models to open instances of other NetLogo models and interact with them.

Existing symbolic architectures, such as Soar and ACT-R, have been used in this way, but here the focus is on a new architecture, Sigma (S), that leverages probabilistic graphical models towards a uniform grand unification of not only the traditional cognitive capabilities but also key non-cognitive aspects, and which thus yields unique opportunities for construction of new kinds of non-modular high-fidelity behavior models.

When a mission is executed, much interaction between commanders and combatants occur through a predefined C3 structure. Our model focuses on measuring the mission completion time, which is dependent on the C3 structure. To achieve this goal, we model the flow of information and command messages between the mission participants, and identify the time-related factors. It is especially important to model a time delay that can be divided into the delay due to the limits of human capabilities and due to communication delay. For measuring the delay of the former type, we design the commander as an infinitely buffered single server with workload-dependent processing time. For communication delay, we use a propagation loss model. Finally, simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the various C3 structures."

Predefined constraints are integrated, and an agglomerate hierarchical clustering-based reassignment algorithm is designed for iteratively assigning occupancy with zone adjacency, orientation, and HVAC layout being considered. Simulation results show that the integration of occupancy based control and occupant reassignment could save up to 9.6% of energy compared to simply applying occupancy based control (18.9% compared to the baseline control that is used in the building. The proposed framework helps reducing unnecessary loads and improves energy efficiency through better informed decision making for occupancy based HVAC controls."

In particular, the asymptotic convergence and the convergence rate of eTSSO are investigated by interpreting the kriging-based search as a stochastic recursion. We show the parallelism between the two paradigms and exploit the deterministic counterpart of eTSSO, the more famous Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) procedure, in order to derive eTSSO structural properties.
This work represents a first step towards a general proof framework for the asymptotic convergence and convergence rate analysis of meta-model based simulation-optimization."

Common procedures handle such problems by optimizing an empirical counterpart, namely via using an empirical distribution of the input. The optimal solutions obtained through such procedures are hence subject to uncertainty of the data. In this paper, we explore techniques to quantify this uncertainty that have potentially good finite-sample performance. We consider three approaches: the empirical likelihood method, nonparametric Bayesian approach, and the bootstrap approach. They are designed to approximate the confidence intervals or posterior distributions of the optimal values or the optimality gaps. We present computational procedures for each of the approaches and discuss their relative benefits. A numerical example on conditional value-at-risk is used to demonstrate
these methods."

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) provides the programmer with complete control over sending and receiving messages between cores, and is fragile with regard to core failures or messages going awry. In contrast, MapReduce handles all communication and is quite robust, but is more rigid in terms of how algorithms can be coded. As expected in a high-performance computing context, we find that MPI is the more efficient of the two environments, although MapReduce is a reasonable choice. Accordingly, MapReduce may be attractive in environments where cores can stall or fail, such as is possible in low-budget cloud computing."

Conservatism leads classical IZ procedures to take too many samples in problems with many alternatives. The Bayes-inspired Indifference Zone (BIZ) procedure, proposed in Frazier (2014), is less conservative than previous procedures, but its proof of validity requires strong assumptions, specifically that samples are normal, and variances are known with an integer multiple structure. In this paper, we show asymptotic validity of a slight modification of the original BIZ procedure as the difference between the best alternative and the second best goes to zero, when the variances are known and finite, and samples are independent and identically distributed, but not necessarily normal."

Enter your equations, any constraints, and an objective (function), and then execute. The solvers are in a library and thus called by name; no coding of numerical methods! We will discuss curve fitting, inverse problems, implicit equations, IVP, and BVP coding and execution.  Many problems execute in less than one-minute and provide an optimum solution. Gurus in industry are going to challenge your solutions, so how do you know that solutions from Calculus-Level Problem-Solving are valid? Will discuss this issue. (See website, http://fortranCalculus.info/example/calculus-programming.html, intro.) Calculus-level languages are based on automatic differentiation and operator overloading. My introduction will provide some history. The first calculus-level language, PROSE, was introduced in 1974 on time-sharing computers. Several big users have in-house versions. Free CD with compiler; free evaluation copy until 1-1-2016. Hands-on usage at my exhibitor table/booth."

Dennis Pegden (Simio LLC)","Simulation has traditionally been applied in system design projects where the basic objective is to evaluate alternatives and predict and improve the long term system performance.  In this role simulation has become a standard business tool with many documented success stories.  Beyond these traditional system design applications simulation can also play a powerful role in scheduling by predicting and improving the short term performance of a system. However these applications have a number or unique requirements which traditional simulation tools do not address.  Simo has been designed from the ground up with a focus on both traditional applications as well as scheduling, with the basic idea that a single Simio model can serve both purposes.   In this paper we will focus on the application of Simio simulation in scheduling."
