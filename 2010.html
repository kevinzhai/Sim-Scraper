In this presentation, we will touch on the complexities that delivering large and complex systems bring to the Research & Development group within EADS, where the objective is to marry the various stakeholders, all of whom are buried deep in operation projects, to a consistent vision of where EADS wishes to go with regards to a common framework for its solution design.  We will talk about the work done by EADS Innovation Works and the Defense & Communication Systems business unit to create an “Executable Architecture,” allowing a set of open enterprise frameworks to co-exist. This will enable suppliers and tool set developers to ensure that the maximum amount of interoperability can be provided within the development cycle, from Requirements Capture, Design, Development and Production, with a single simulation backbone giving verification and validation throughout the chain on a single data model.
Current architecture framework products support only static analysis. Objects and Relationships in static architecture products must be mapped to dynamic models to create executable architectures, which offer a means to conduct dynamic analysis of systems or capabilities described through an Integrated Architecture. The challenges include mapping and data transformation between tools, capturing sufficient representation of system and operational environment in executable architectures, and collecting appropriate data to populate activities in executable architectures.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="005 // VENDOR TRACK I"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">VENDOR TRACK I</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Vendor Presentations</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em"></span><br /><i>Introduction to JMP</i><br />Mia Stephens (SAS Institute Inc., JMP Division) and Ed Hughes (SAS Institute Inc.)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_4_3179" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_4_3179').hide();

Without such balance, the course becomes a product training experience and the students, who may either be consumers or producers of simulation models, are not grounded in the necessary fundamentals. Addressing this challenge, the authors have leveraged their diverse teaching experiences and collaborated on a new textbook for simulation. Professor Allen Greenwood of Mississippi State University has recently used this approach and book in a required undergraduate course, graduate elective course, required graduate course in Europe, and industry short courses. In this session, the authors will discuss their approach and the concepts that form the basis of the text. They will also discuss some of the lessons learned from its use and how those lessons have become a part of the latest edition.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Vendor Presentations</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em"></span><br /><i>Resource Management in SAS Simulation Studio</i><br />Hong Chen and Emily Lada (SAS Institute Inc.)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_12_9439" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_12_9439').hide();

In Simulation Studio, resources are modeled as special types of hierarchical entities that can be assigned attributes and flow through the model. Furthermore, resource entities can be seized and released by other entities to fulfill resource demands. Flexible resource entity rules are used to specify these demands, as well as the requirements of other resource operations, such as state and capacity changes.  The hierarchical, entity-based approach in Simulation Studio allows the user more control over resource behavior and provides many advantages over alternative resource management techniques, especially in the areas of resource
scheduling and preemption.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/002.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Creating and Visualizing Web Simulations</i><br />Michael Bean (Forio Simulations)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_14_2995" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_14_2995').hide();

For case (i), we review flexible distribution systems, while we review two widely used multivariate input models for case (ii). Finally, we review nonhomogeneous Poisson processes for the last case.

It begins with a “human-centric” view of the individual combatant and small unit operations, which incorporates the concept of the individual as an integrated weapon system, the Warrior System. It addresses representation of situation awareness/situation understanding (SA/SU), and “soft” factors – morale, leadership, training, nationality/ethnicity, through agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM supports exploration of SA/SU by allowing each agent an idiosyncratic, perception-based view of the environment,  rather than  the simulation “god’s eye” view of ground truth.  Using ABM further supports the view of small unit operations as CAS - dynamically interacting open systems, characterized by “emergence”, with non-linear and chaotic behaviors. A critical problem for Warrior Systems analysis is the lack of engineering models of complex integrated systems. ABM/CAS addresses this lack by “growing” or “evolving” engineering models of systems whose complexity resists traditional reductionist approaches.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/013.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wednesday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Agent-Based Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Hong Wan (Purdue University)<br /></span><br /><i>Agent-Based Simulation Tutorial</i><br />Wai Kin Victor Chan (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Young-Jun Son (The University of Arizona) and Charles Macal (Argonne National Laboratory)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_60_8589" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_60_8589').hide();

Few full length courses exist on agent-based modeling and a standard curriculum has not yet been established, but there is considerable demand to include ABS into simulation courses. Modelers often come to agent-based simulation by way of self-study or attendance at tutorials and short courses. Although there is substantial overlap, there are many aspects of ABS that differ from discrete-event simulation (DES) and System Dynamics (SD), including applicable problem domains, disciplines and backgrounds of students, and the underpinnings of its computational implementation. These factors make ABS difficult to include as an incremental add-on to existing simulation courses. This paper reports on some approaches to teaching the modeling of complex systems and agent-based simulation that the authors have used in a range of classes and workshops.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/024.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Simple Agent-Based Social Impact Theory Model of Student Stem Selection</i><br />Theodore Allen and Nixon Davis (The Ohio State University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_82_6044" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_82_6044').hide();

We propose a simple two-stage, agent-based simulation based on social impact theory to predict the % yield of STEM majors. The model indicates that changes with minimal (if any) cost could more than double the STEM yield. For example, allocating the STEM-oriented teaching talent in the first two years rather than in the last two years could increase yields by approximately 5.5%.

The challenge addressed is how to educate the novice analyst as a professional rather than letting him become an artist – being very much the current practice. The need for professionalism is related to good quality simulation research and education in a straightforward way. Emerging insights on the relevance of conceptual modeling for simulation project success, increasing system complexity, and stakeholders taking up an active role in modeling and solution creation, further stress this need.

The process-oriented approach is used as a basis for analyzing operations and supply chain management problems with emphasis on exploring relationships among different value chain processes such as manufacturing, logistics, marketing and finance. Process flow simulation is used to obtain quantitative process performance measures. Three main components of the environment are catalog of case studies, enterprise management dashboard and process modeling component. These components are implemented using commercially available spreadsheet and process modeling software. The environment can be used for implementation and exploration of different cases studies. Usage of the environment is demonstrated by analyzing a sample  case study.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/028.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>The Blood Supply Game</i><br />Navonil Mustafee (Swansea University) and Korina Katsaliaki (International Hellenic University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_88_5238" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_88_5238').hide();

The SimCenter at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga recently in-troduced a class in discrete event simulation with the goal of providing sufficient coverage of the topic to enable any of the SimCenter’s students completing the course to work effectively in a typical industry- or government-supported simulation modeling group.  The course is structured around a diverse set of engi-neering problems rather than traditional industrial engineering-type simulations in order to present the material in a more palatable fashion for students who come primarily from other disciplines.

A formal approach to simulation interoperability based on set theory and date modeling theory was developed. The formal model of data in M&S capturing possible representations of real or imagined things in the world including definitions for existential and transformational dependencies is presented. Existential dependencies capture the relationships within a model while transformational dependencies capture the relationships between interactions with a model. These definitions are used to formally specify interoperation, the ability to exchange information, as a necessary condition for interoperability. The language needed for ambassador agents is specified using the formal approach to interoperability.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/033.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>To Agent-based Simulation from System Dynamics</i><br />Charles M.

Forrester’s System Dynamics (SD) is another longstanding technique for modeling social systems. Several classical models of systems, such as the Kermack-McKendrick model of epidemiology, the Lotka-Volterra equations for modeling predator-prey relationships are formulated as systems of differential equations and have corresponding System Dynamics representations as difference equations. The ABS and SD modeling approaches take fundamentally different perspectives when modeling a system, which can be characterized as bottom-up (ABS) versus top-down (SD). Yet many systems can be equivalently modeled by either approach. In this paper, we present a formal specification for SD and ABS models, use the specification to derive an equivalent ABS representations, and present an example of an SIR epidemic model having SD and ABS counterparts.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/034.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Simulation Method for Solving Hybrid Influence Diagrams in Decision Making</i><br />Xi Chen and Enlu Zhou (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_100_4605" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_100_4605').hide();

This paper presents a simulation-based approach for solving decision making problems formulated by hybrid IDs, which involve both discrete and continuous decision and chance variables. In the proposed method, Monte-Carlo simulation is applied in both approximating the expected conditional utility and solving the optimal decision strategies. The forward Monte-Carlo method is presented for expectation calculation, and it does not require Bayesian inference as in the standard “roll-back” method. The cross-entropy method in optimization is introduced to solve the optimal strategies. The decision variables are treated as random variables, and the decision strategies are solved by recursively updating the probability density of the decision variables.

However, a trend towards distributed generation, distributed storage and demand side load management is seen to improve the energy efficiency.
In order to analyze the impact and requirements of these emerging technologies and control methodologies, good simulation models and software is required.
In this paper, an improved simulator is presented to model (domestic) energy usage to analyze control strategies and improved technology on the system as a whole. 
Compared to the previous model, this model is more expressive and allows more future scenarios to be analyzed.

To overcome these difficulties, we develop a summary function elasticity analysis method, which aids in analyzing the impact of a parameter on some global summary of the system state. A summary function defines a scalar field over state space summarizing the global state of a system. Summary function elasticity with respect to a parameter measures the ratio of the proportional change in the function to the proportional change in a parameter. We use an individual-based viral spread model to demonstrate that this new method offers greater simplicity than eigenvalue elasticity analysis while retaining most of its advantages. This method can be readily scaled to analyze impacts of parameters on larger-scale System Dynamics models.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/037.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Improving Model Understanding using Statistical Screening</i><br />David Ford (Texas A&M University), Tim Taylor (University of Kentucky) and Andrew Ford (Washington State University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_106_4036" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_106_4036').hide();

It addresses the issue of  obtaining input data as well as validating the output of the model at the end of the simulation. 
A social system built primarily of cognitively detailed agents (such as PMF Serv based StateSim) can provide multiple levels of correspondence, both at observable and abstract aggregated levels. In the past, we have employed a triangulation of multiple validation techniques, including face validation achieved through the modelers’ and experts’ inspection  or modified Turing test as appropriate, and formal validation tests including correspondence testing as well as model docking.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/040.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Mission-Driven Needs:  Understanding the Military Relevance of Socio-Cultural Capabilities</i><br />P.

This paper describes the clash of cultures that occurs when the deterministic mindset meets non-deterministic models and in which the desire for prediction can only be met by descriptive models. This disjuncture is exacerbated by the fact that the vocabularies, modeling assumptions and data sets that have supported the military modeling and simulation community do not provide adequate bases for the inclusion of social science models. We contend that in such an environment, solutions must be crafted to be specific to missions, areas of operation (geographic regions), levels of command (tactical, strategic, etc.) and operator skill level. By using the above parameters to clarify needs, the community will be better positioned to provide viable solutions supported by available data that can meet the expectations of end users.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/041.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Modeling Strategies I</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Richard Nance (Virginia Tech)<br /></span><br /><i>Out-of-Order Execution and Structural Equivalence of Simulation Models</i><br />Tobin Bergen-Hill and Ernest Page (MITRE Corporation)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_114_2529" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_114_2529').hide();

Spe-cifically brought under scrutiny are the restrictions for applying a rule that expands a compound event vertex when converting a simulation graph model (SGM) into an extended SGM. By checking for inter-dependencies of state variables within the vertex, one can ensure that the logical structure of the original model is preserved during expansion, allowing for “out-of-order” execution of events - thus permitting a greater class of models to be deemed structurally (and behaviorally) equivalent. An example is provided of establishing structural equivalence between two discrete event simulations derived from the same model, which benefits from the revised expansion rule.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/042.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Context-Based Multi-Perspective Modeling and Simulation Framework</i><br />Ça&#287;r&#305; Tekinay, Mamadou Seck, Michele Fumarola and Alexander Verbraeck (Delft University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_116_3135" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_116_3135').hide();

Large-scale complex systems like energy grids, air-ground traffic control systems and logistics systems are designed in multi-actor environments and hence require various perspectives (e.g. financial, operational, and environmental) to serve different actors. Although this is the case, current simulation based decision support environments lack the capability of covering multiple system perspectives at once and in different levels of details to provide better understanding of the systems. In this paper, the key challenges and preliminary design ideas are discussed to provide a multi-resolution modeling capability. We introduce a context-based ''view'' concept as an enabler to support multi-perspective modeling in multi-actor environments.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/043.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Modeling and Simulation for User Assistance in Smart Environments</i><br />Alexander Steiniger and Adelinde M.

Our work is mainly applied in health care studies, where many stakeholders with multiple views and objectives are involved in an often politically charged environment. We develop a participative conceptual modelling framework, which uses tools from soft systems methodology, a problem structuring approach. The benefit of this approach lies in that it supports the conceptual modelling process by engaging stakeholders in a structured and participative way. It involves facilitated workshops, using a set of tools developed. A case study of the conceptual modelling process undertaken for an obesity care modelling study is provided to illustrate the proposed framework and tools.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/045.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Proposed Visual Wiki System for Gathering Knowledge about Discrete Event Systems</i><br />Peter Dungan and Cathal Heavey (University of Limerick)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_122_2384" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_122_2384').hide();

One issue in this phase is the need for clear communication, between the modeler, and experts on the system being examined. These domain experts may not be versed in modeling techniques or languages.
Another issue is the potential benefit offered by the recording of the gathered knowledge, in a way that facilitates its reuse outside of the modeling project itself.
Existing approaches to the construction of a system description have different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore a combination of different model types, in an integrated manner, could be most effective. Visual wiki software is proposed to facilitate this. 
Wikis are proven as a platform for incrementally growing shared knowledge bases.

Modeling objectives and model properties at each scale are discussed and existing efforts are reviewed. In order to ensure modeling consistency, it is critical to address the coupling among models at different scales, i.e. how less detailed models are derived from more detailed models and, conversely, how more detailed models are aggregated to less detailed models. Therefore, a consistent multiscale modeling approach is proposed based on field theory and modeling strategy at each scale is discussed. In addition, a family of special cases are formulated. Numerical and empirical results suggest that these special cases perform satisfactorily and aggregate to realistic macroscopic behavior. By ensuring model coupling and modeling consistency, the proposed approach is able to establish the theoretical foundation for traffic modeling and simulation at multiple scales seamlessly within a single system.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/050.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">A Brief History of Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Jane L.

Results showed that the implementations were docked for adult but not for aquatic mosquito populations. In this paper, following the 'Divide and Conquer' paradigm, we compartmentalize the simulation world to prohibit the propagation of errors between compartments. Using four separate implementations that sprung from the same core model, we describe a series of docking experiments, analyze the results, and show how they lead to a successful dock.

We hypothesized that those mechanisms have counterparts in rats.  Mobile objects map to compounds.  One analogue is comprised of a linear sequence of 20 identical, quasi-autonomous functional units called sinusoidal segments (SSs).  SSs detect and respond to compound-generated response signals and the local level of a gradient.  Each SS adapts to new information with the objective of improving efficiency (lowering costs).

There are already numerous spatial approaches focusing on the simulation of cells. Recently, they have been complemented by a set of spatial modeling languages whose operational semantics are tied partly to existing simulation algorithms. These modeling languages allow an explicit description of spatial phenomena, and facilitate analysis of the temporal spatial dynamics of cells by a clear separation between model, semantics, and simulator. With the supported level of abstraction, each of those offers a different perception of the spatial phenomena under study. In this paper, we give an overview of existing modeling formalisms and discuss some ways of combining approaches to tackle the problem the computational costs induced by spatial dynamics.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/055.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Verification and Testing of Biological Models</i><br />Allan Clark, Stephen Gilmore and Jane Hillston (University of Edinburgh) and Peter Kemper (College of William and Mary)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_142_9062" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_142_9062').hide();

Such models stem from the potential for multiple levels of phosphorylation or from the formation of multiprotein complexes. We seek to support such models by augmenting an existing modeling and simulation system. Interactions between multistate species can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the potential state space. This creates a challenge when using Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). Both the network-free algorithm (NFA) and various rules-based methods have been proposed to more efficiently simulate such models. We show how to further improve NFA to integrate population-based and particle-based features. We then present a population-based scheme for the stochastic simulation of rule-based models. A complexity analysis is presented comparing the proposed methods. We present numerical experiments for two sample models that demonstrate the power of the proposed methods.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/057.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Ontology</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Simon Taylor (Brunel University)<br /></span><br /><i>Ontology for Simulation</i><br />Charles Turnitsa, Jose J.

Unlike other disciplines where ontologies are used, such as Information Systems and Medicine, ontologies in M&S do not depart from a set of requirements but from a research question which is contingent on a modeler. Thus, the semiotic triangle is used to present that different implemented ontologies are representations of different conceptual models whose commonality depends on which research question is being asked. Ontologies can be applied to better capture the modeler’s perspective. The elicitation of ontological, epistemological, and teleological considerations is suggested. These considerations may lead to better differentiation between conceptualizations, which for a computer are of importance for use, reuse and composability of models and interoperability of simulations.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/058.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Towards an Ontological Foundation of Discrete Event Simulation</i><br />Giancarlo Guizzardi (UFES) and Gerd Wagner (Brandenburg University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_148_5147" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_148_5147').hide();

The application of this technology to simulation in industry has, however, been negligible. This research investigates grid technology in the context of Commercial Simulation Packages (CSPs). Towards this end, the paper identifies (a) six CSP-specific grid services, (b) identifies grid middleware that could be used to provide the CSP-specific grid services, and (c)  list CSPs that include vendor-specific solutions for these grid services. The authors hope that this research will lead to an increased awareness of the potential of grid computing among simulation end users and CSP vendors.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/060.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Distributed Modeling and Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: David Nicol (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)<br /></span><br /><i>On Deciding between Conservative and Optimistic Approaches on Massively Parallel Platforms</i><br />Christopher D.

This gap is bridged here, by undertaking a parameterized performance study

contrast to theoretical insights from analytical studies, our study is based on
actual implementation in software, incurring the actual messaging and
computational overheads for both conservative and optimistic synchronization

analyzed, with different event timestamp distributions and available

Research in this field has made the case for employing agent-based models to investigate this social phenomena. This research builds on the basic tenants of these previous approaches as a way to investigate the nature of global connectivity as it affects the standardization of a strong central culture of a specific region. The simulation runs conducted in this study make clear that the more cultural features that “characterize” agents, the less likely it is for their cultures to assimilate.  The simulations also indicate that even when a culture has a 50%-60% chance of being attracted to the features of an outside culture, almost total cultural migration is possible.

However, one of the additional needed issues is that simulation assets need to be part of a formal Business Process Management (BPM) to allow practical across-enterprise collaboration. The Workflow mechanism promises to help with this situation. Further, workflows provide automation, repeatable and reusable simulation experiments.

It is still a great challenge to scale virtual worlds to provide rich user experiences, high level of realism, and innovative usages. There are three unique simulation requirements in scaling virtual worlds: (1) large-scale, real time and perpetual simulations with distributed interaction, (2) simultaneous visualization for many endpoints with unique perspectives, and (3) multiple simulation engines with different operation characteristics. In this paper, we review the challenges in meeting these requirements, present the scalability barriers we observed in current virtual worlds, and discuss potential virtual world architecture and solutions to address the challenges and overcome the barriers.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/070.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Model-Driven Engineering of Second-Life-Style Simulations</i><br />Gerd Wagner (Brandenburg University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_172_8811" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_172_8811').hide();

We built the Second China Project as a hybrid immersive, knowledge-based software platform for use in cultural training. Is this training effective? More specifically, what are the effects of immersion on memory and other cognitive variables? We chose to base our research questions, not around a specific user group, but more generally around a category of training system--one involving the use of multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs). We present  the architecture of an experiment designed to test whether MUVEs are effective training platforms, and to explain the process used in developing a testing environment to determine the precise nature of that effectiveness.

In this paper, we further investigate the role of perception in human actions and examine the representation of perceptual elements in affordance-based modeling formalism. We also propose necessary and sufficient conditions for mapping perception-based human actions into systems theory to develop a predictive modeling formalism in the context of prospective control. A driving example is used to show how to build a formal model of human-involved complex system for prospective control. The suggested modeling frameworks will increase the soundness and completeness of a modeling formalism as well as can be used as guide to model human activities in a complex system.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/073.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>An Integrated Pedestrian Behavior Model Based On Extended Decision Field Theory And Social Force Model</i><br />Hui Xi (University of Arizona), Seungho Lee (Samsung Electronics Co.

Some research has focused on the analysis and design of such software, but none has truly addressed the need for automated assistance in creating agent-based simulators from initial problem comprehension. This paper proposes an approach addressing the gap and supporting the spiral process of generating an agent-based simulator. In particular, this approach enables the incremental and iterative representation of a problem and its translation into an executable model. Initially using an unconstrained ontology, the designer draws conceptual graphs representing the problem. Progressively, graph elements are linked hierarchically under concepts that are part of a predefined generic Scenarization Vocabulary (i. e. agent, patient, behaviour, attribute, parameter, variable …). This Scenarization semantic defines roles in the simulation. This approach is part of a broader research effort known as IMAGE that develops a toolset concept supporting collaborative understanding of complex situations.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/075.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wednesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Input Data Modeling</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Michael Overstreet (Old Dominion University)<br /></span><br /><i>How to Model A TCP/IP Network Using Only 20 Parameters</i><br />Kevin Mills (National Institute of Standards and Technology), Edward Schwartz (Carnegie Mellon University) and Jian Yuan (Tsinghua University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_182_4999" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_182_4999').hide();

Further, the paper demonstrates how this concise model supports efficient design of simulation experiments. The model has been implemented as a sequential simulation called MesoNet, which uses Simulation Language with Extensibility (SLX). The paper discusses model resource requirements and the performance of SLX.

The fictional bicycle model will include several simulation features such as a discrete event component, a flow portion, an agent based part, equation based power portion, and optimization.  The results indicate that the approach is viable and that inverse modeling can be used to estimate internal activities.

However, different sources of disturbance make the development challenging. In order to provide valid sensor data for various scenarios an adequate simulation environment is needed. In this paper we present a real-time scene simulator that allows the simulation of dynamic indoor environments and the resulting output signals of infrared sensors. The composition of such environments is simplified by using an object and sensor database. In order to enable real-time processing, OpenGL and hardware acceleration is applied. Evaluations show that the accuracy of the chosen approach is sufficient to develop algorithms for a Thermal Infrared Localization System (ThILo). Furthermore, it can be shown that real-time processing is possible for a complete location system in typical indoor environments.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/079.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Seamless High Speed Simulation of VHDL Components in the Context of Comprehensive Computing Systems using the Virtual Machine FAUmachine</i><br />Stefan Potyra, Matthias Sand, Volkmar Sieh and Dietmar Fey (Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen/Nuremberg)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_190_4699" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_190_4699').hide();

the interaction between hard- and software implementations, even if no prototype

The DBN metamodels reveal the time evolution of simulation and enable alternative what-if analyses unlike previous metamodels that imitate the simulation model as an input-output mapping. In earlier studies, the analysis of DBNs is restricted to discrete time
instants selected beforehand in the construction phase of the metamodel. This paper introduces an extension to the framework of DBN metamodeling that employs multivariate interpolation and allows the analysis in continuous time. In practice, an approximation for the probability distribution of the simulation state is calculated by interpolating between conditional probabilities given by the DBN.
The utilization of multivariate interpolation in the context of DBN metamodeling is illustrated by examples dealing with Poisson arrival processes and air combat simulation.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/084.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Common Random Numbers and Stochastic Kriging</i><br />Xi Chen, Bruce Ankenman and Barry L.

MSER-5 uses the data-truncation point that minimizes the half-length of the usual batch-means CI computed from the truncated data set.  N-Skart uses a randomness test to determine the data-truncation point beyond which spaced batch means are approximately independent of each other and the simulation's initial condition; then using truncated nonspaced batch means, N-Skart exploits separate adjustments to the CI half-length that account for the effects on the distribution of the underlying Student's t-statistic arising from skewness and
autocorrelation of the batch means.

However, although there are many problems of practical interests that can be cast in the framework of simulation optimization, it is often difficult to obtain an understanding of their structure, making them very challenging. Direct search methods are a class of deterministic optimization methods particularly designed for black-box optimization problems. In this paper, we present a class of direct search methods for simulation optimization problems with stochastic noise.

We propose fitting a statistical model to the objective function values obtained in such a search, and show how the fitted model can be used to estimate the best value obtained when the search effort is limited and how this value compares with the unknown true optimum value. A possible use of this approach is in combinatorial optimization problems. The dimension in such a problem is not usually considered, but if a dimension can be associated with it, then it is likely to be high.

Previously published work gives a method for using bootstrapping to develop fixed-width confidence intervals with a specified coverage probability around a property of interest. Empirical evidence is provided in support of the use of this approach for building fixed-width confidence intervals around both means and quantiles.
Additionally, the use of fixed-width confidence intervals for bootstrapped R&S is demonstrated. For two systems, R&S is performed by building a confidence interval around the difference between two systems. Simultaneous fixed-width confidence intervals are used for R&S on more than 2 systems, and the approach is demonstrated for three systems. The technique is shown to be effective for R&S based on both quantiles and means.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/093.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Modification of Cheng&apos;s Method: An Alternative Factor Screening Method for Stochastic Simulation Models</i><br />Reza Yaesoubi (Harvard Medical School), Stephen D.

This represents the flight path of a boid. Other boids are generated that flock around this data boid. The coordinates of these new boids are mapped back to simulate replicates of the original time series. The flock size determines the number of replicates.

The approach is first illustrated analytically using a simplified two point example. A more general Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis approach is subsequently proposed to handle more general assumptions on the parameters and design.The general MCMC approach is compared with the stochastic kriging model based on the M/M/1 simulation system.

As a result, the allocating agent needs to adaptively learn how to interpret the bids and estimate the requesting agent's biases. Learning must occur as quickly as possible, because each suboptimal resource allocation incurs an economic cost.

The knowledge gradient for continuous parameters uses a continuous approximation of the expected value of a single measurement to guide the choice of where to collect information next.  We show how to find the parameter setting that maximizes the expected value of a measurement by optimizing a continuous but nonconcave surface.  We compare the method to sequential kriging for a series of test surfaces, and then demonstrate its performance in the calibration of an expensive industrial simulator.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/100.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Queueing and Estimation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Eunji Lim (University of Miami)<br /></span><br /><i>Transient Analysis of General Queueing Systems via Simulation-Based Transfer Function Modeling</i><br />Feng Yang and Jingang Liu (West Virginia University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_230_7910" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_230_7910').hide();

The objective is to develop a statistical methodology, integrated with extensive offline simulation and preliminary queueing analysis, for the estimation of a small number of transfer function models (TFMs) that quantify the input-output dynamics of a general queueing system. The input here is the time-varying release rate of entities to the system; the time-dependent output performances include the output rate of entities and the mean of the work in process (i.e., number of entities in the system). The resulting TFMs are difference equations, like the discrete approximations of the ordinary differential equations provided by an analytical approach, while possessing the high fidelity of simulation. The proposed method is expected to overcome the shortcomings of the existing transient analysis approaches, i.e., the computational burden of simulation and the lack of fidelity of analytical queueing models.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/101.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Robust Estimation of Multivariate Jump-Diffusion Processes</i><br />Andrey Torzhkov, Puneet Sharma and Amit Chakraborty (Siemens Corporate Research)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_232_1686" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_232_1686').hide();

This sum is observed over time as a multi-variate jump-diffusion time-series. Our objective is to identify realizations of all components of the mix in a robust and scalable way. First, we formulate this model as an Mixed-Integer-Programming (MIP) optimization problem extending traditional least-squares estimation framework to include discrete jump processes. Then we propose a Dynamic Programming (DP) approximate algorithm that is reasonably fast & accurate and scales polynomially with time horizon.

The system with the largest (or smallest) mean performance is deemed as the best system. However, the system with the best mean performance may be an undesirable choice because of its large variance. Variance is a measure of risk. A highly variable system performance shows that the system is not under control. Both mean and variance of a performance metric need to be compared to determine the best system. We present a statistically valid selection procedure for comparing simulated systems based on a mean-variance dominance relationship. The system with the best mean and smallest variance is deemed as the best system. If there is not a unique best system, the procedure identifies a set of nondominant systems.

In these models, there are often profound uncertainties whose dependence among themselves is typically difficult to specify or calibrate. Monte Carlo simulations are often used to evaluate these policies. However, the simulation approach requires that the distribution of the uncertain parameters are clearly specified. In this paper, we adopt the widely used multivariate normal distribution to model the uncertain parameters. However, we assume that the mean vector and covariance matrix of the distribution are within an ambiguity set. We show how to find the worst performance in the ambiguity set by solving a sequence of log determinant problems. This performance provides a robust (worst-case) evaluation of the policy. We test our algorithm on a famous environmental economic model, known as the DICE model, and obtain some insightful and interesting results.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/119.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Using Simulation Optimization As a Decision Support Tool For Supply Chain Coordination With Contracts</i><br />Hamidreza Eskandari and Mohamad Darayi (Tarbiat Modares University) and Christopher D.

We found that assigning one weight per category per system provides better results than the other options.  Additionally, we projected raw statistics directly and compared the results to projecting rate statistics scaled by predicted player usage.

They do this by directing policy and advocating for resources to provide secure, reliable and timely information to the Joint Warfighter.  The Systems Integration Directorate has primary responsibility to understand warfighter command, control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance needs; conduct gap analysis; and develop and enforce policy and strategy to ensure seamless, interoperable and synergistic joint warfighting capabilities and effects across all military domains.  

Warfighting integration requires integrating multiple facets: doctrine, organizational structure, training, material solutions, leadership, personnel, and facilities.  To accomplish their mission, the Systems Integration Directorate is developing an integration partnership with other Air Staff organizations to ensure all user needs are met.  The partnership strives to deliver integrated, interoperable warfighting capabilities through a framework that consists of policy, governance, and informed decisions based on credible analysis.  Modeling and simulation provides the foundation for credible analysis and integrated training in complex environments.  This paper will describe the analytic framework being developed to support warfighting integration and some of the live, virtual and constructive (LVC) simulation environments that enable analysis,   the distributed LVC environment used to enable realistic integrated training, and finally some challenges and the way ahead for USAF warfighting integration.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Navy Modeling and Simulation: Design of Experiments</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Rachel Johnson (Naval Postgraduate School)<br /></span><br /><i>Simulating Pirate Behavior to Exploit Environmental Information</i><br />Leslie Esher, Stacey Hall and Eva Regnier (Naval Postgraduate School), James A.

Movement staff can then decide upon the best course of action, taking into account issues such as lift asset availability, and time and budgetary constraints.

Conversely, many highly process-oriented systems, such as manufacturing environments, tend to be modeled via “top-down” methods, including discrete or continuous event  simulations.  As a result, potentially critical at-tributes of the modeled entities or resources (spatial properties or adaptability) may not be adequately captured or developed.

For example, players of a team defending a goal may be assigned equal-spaced zones to defend or units in a military force may be assigned equal-spaced sectors to control.  As the dynamics of the situation unfold and as entities move, withdraw, or enter the space; the other entities cooperate by adjusting their positions to retain load balance.   Various ways that this geometric cooperation can be accomplished, both from the perspectives of central and local control, are developed, analyzed, and simulated. This problem is related to other geometric cooperation problems such as movements in multi-player pursuit-evasion games and balancing loads for other generally non-geometric algorithms.  The authors use the metrics to establish a framework for a theory of geometric cooperation.   Simulations, metrics, and results of the algorithms’ performance in various scenarios are presented.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/128.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Modeling and Analyzing Transient Military Air Traffic Control</i><br />William Kaczynski (United States Military Academy) and Lawrence Leemis and John Drew (The College of William & Mary)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_288_3156" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_288_3156').hide();

This paper describes our approach to this challenge, providing 1) a rule-based method for modeling Ground Soldier situational awareness and devices that influence situational awareness and 2) a user friendly graphical authoring tool for creating these rules.

ART is a vulnerability assessment tool in which agent-based models of simplified military scenarios are repeatedly and automatically generated, executed and varied. Nature-inspired heuristic techniques are utilized to drive the exploration of simulation models to exhibit desired system behaviors. To date, ART investigations have essentially addressed the evolution of a limited fixed set of parameters determining the agents' behavior. We propose to extend ART to widen the range of evolvable simulation model parameters. Using this "evolvable simulation" approach, we conduct experiments in which the agents' structure is evolved.  Specifically, a maritime scenario is examined where the individual trajectories of belligerent vessels are evolved to break Blue. These experiments are conducted using a modular evolutionary framework coined CASE. The results present counter-intuitive outcomes and suggest that evolvable simulation is a promising technique to enhance ART.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/133.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Advanced Modeling Techniques for Military Problems</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Raymond Hill (Air Force Institute of Technology)<br /></span><br /><i>Game Theoretic Simulation Metamodeling Using Stochastic Kriging</i><br />Jouni Pousi, Jirka Poropudas and Kai Virtanen (Aalto University School of Science and Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_298_5790" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_298_5790').hide();

In this approach, stochastic kriging is used to estimate payoff functions of players involved in a game represented by a simulation model. Based on the estimated payoff functions, the players' best responses to the values of the decision variables chosen by the other players are calculated. In the approach, the concept of best response sets in the context of game theoretic simulation metamodeling is applied. These sets contain the values of the players' decision variables which cannot be excluded from being a best response and allow the identification of the potential Nash equilibria. The utilization of the approach is demonstrated with simulation examples where payoff functions are known a priori. Additionally, it is applied to data acquired by using a discrete event air combat simulation model.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/134.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Comparison of the Accuracy of Discrete Event and Discrete Time</i><br />Arnold Buss and Ali Al Rowaei (Naval Postgraduate School)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_300_6298" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_300_6298').hide();

Since time discretization is known to affect the results when numerically solving differential equations, it stands to reason that it might likewise affect the results of such simulations. This paper demonstrates that is indeed the case. Using simple queueing models, we demonstrate that the size of the time step can have a substantial impact on estimated measures of performance. While large time steps can execute faster than a corresponding discrete event model, there can be substantial errors in the estimates. Conversely, with small time steps the results match both the discrete event measures as well as the analytic values, but can take substantially longer to execute.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/135.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Representing Dynamic Social Networks in Discrete Event Social Simulation</i><br />Jonathan Alt and Stephen Lieberman (Naval Postgraduate School)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_302_636" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_302_636').hide();

Previous work described the results of social simulation using a static homophily network. In order to gain the full benefit of modeling societies a representation of how the social network changes over time is required. This paper introduces the implementation of a dynamic homophily network, along with a case study exploring the sensitivity of model outputs to the parameters describing the network and applying social network change detection methods (SNCD) to model output.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/136.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Military Applications of Distributed Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Raymond Hill (Air Force Institute of Technology)<br /></span><br /><i>A Fast Parallel Matching Algorithm for Continuous Interest Management</i><br />Elvis S.

Many DVEs employ interest management schemes to reduce bandwidth consumption and thus enhance the scalability of the system. Most of the existing interest management approaches, however, have a fundamental disadvantage - they perform interest matching at discrete time intervals. As a result, they would fail to report events between consecutive time-steps of simulation which leads to incorrect simulations. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for interest matching which aims to capture missing events between discrete time-steps. This algorithm facilitates parallelism by distributing the workload of matching process across multiple processors. Since it is increasingly common to deploy commercial DVE applications on shared-memory multiprocessor machines, using the parallel algorithm for these applications would be more suitable than the existing serial algorithms.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/137.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Systems Engineering for Distributed, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) Simulation</i><br />Scott Gallant (Effective Applications Corporation) and Chris Gaughan (US Army RDEC)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_306_6515" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_306_6515').hide();

Systems engineering efforts for distributed simulation environments are typically based on the middleware transport used, the applications available and the constraints placed on the technical team including network, computer and personnel limitations. To facilitate community re-use, systems engineering should focus on integrated operational function decomposition. This links data elements produced within the simulation to the functional capabilities required by the user. The system design should be captured at a functional level and subsequently linked to the technical design. Doing this within a data-driven systems engineering infrastructure allows generative programming techniques to assist accurate, flexible and rapid architecture development.

Many factors such as aggregate gradation and moisture level affect the quality of hot mix asphalt. As state agencies dictate certain standards on quality of the product, some quality assurance techniques have been used in HMA plants. In the current practice, a production sample is taken and analyzed in the lab. The lab analysis takes approximately two hours, making it difficult to quickly correct production mix problems. In this paper, a new online process control of asphalt production system designed to overcome this problem is described. In the proposed system, an image processing system continuously analyzes images of the samples and the required corrective action is taken instantly by a computerized optimization system.

The aim of this study is the quantitative evaluation of the impact of sensor embedded products (SEPs) on the performance of an appliance disassembly line. First, separate design of experiments studies based on orthogonal arrays are performed for the cases with and without SEPs. Discrete event simulation models of both cases were developed to calculate various performance measures under different experimental conditions. Then, the results of pair-wise t-tests comparing the two cases, based on different performance measures, are presented. The results show the superiority of SEPs over conventional products for all performance measures considered in the study.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/146.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Simulation Model to Justify Remanufacturing Policies</i><br />Farhad Azadivar (University of Massachussetts Darmouth) and Sharon Ordoobadi (University of Massachusetts)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_322_7121" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_322_7121').hide();

However, discarding returned parts is neither economical nor environmentally desirable. As a result there is a great need for policies on remanufacturing aftermarket products from returned units. Two of the factors that affect justification of setting up after-market reproduction runs are the flow rate and composition of good returned parts. These factors are stochastic functions of the production rate for the primary product and the reliability of individual subassemblies. A closed form solution for estimating these variables is often difficult to develop. This paper presents a general formulation for simulation modeling of such remanufacturing systems and estimation of the flow rate and composition of good returned parts.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/147.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Design and Development of a Sustainability Toolkit for Simulation</i><br />Michael Kuhl and Xi Zhou (Rochester Institute of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_324_8850" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_324_8850').hide();

Lean principles are widely applied in semi or fully automated production processes. This research highlights the application of the lean principles to manual assembly processes, where the operator characteristics are considered as deterministic of operator schedule.  In this study, a manual circuit breaker assembly line is examined, where operator skill levels, attention spans, classified as reliability measures considered to select the most suitable resource allocation and break schedules.  The effect of operator attributes on the process is modeled and simulated using Arena, followed by a hierarchical preference aggregation technique as the decision making tool.  This paper provides an operator schedule selection approach which can be both employed in manual and semi – automated production processes.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/149.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Conceptual Modeling In Simulation Projects By Mean Adapted IDEF: An Application In A Brazilian Tech Company</i><br />José Arnaldo Montevechi, Fabiano Leal, Alexandre Pinho, Rafael Florêncio Costa and Mona Liza Oliveira (Universidade Federal de Itajubá) and André Luís Silva (PadTec)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_328_3217" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_328_3217').hide();

However, most of these techniques provide little specific support to the programming. The main cause of this is the fact that these techniques were not developed with the same logic used in simulation models. From this issue, this paper presents an industrial application of a new conceptual modeling technique, named IDEF-SIM (Integrated Definition Methods – Simulation) currently under development by the authors. This adapted IDEF uses logic elements present in techniques such as IDEF0 and IDEF3, but in a way that is similar to the process interpretation logic usually used in simulation projects. This way, it can be noticed an increase in the conceptual model’s utility, which might facilitate the simulation model programming, verification and validation and the scenarios creation. Additionally, the paper presents the benefits of using IDEF-SIM to create the conceptual model of a Brazilian tech company manufacturing cell.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/150.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Simulation of a Stochastic Model for a Service System</i><br />Srinivas Chakravarthy, Catherine Brickner, Dennis Indrawan and Derrick Williams (Kettering University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_330_3607" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_330_3607').hide();

Any customer finding the buffer is considered lost. An arriving customer belongs to one of three types, and the admitted customer is served by one of many dedicated servers (exclusively set aside for each of the three types of customers) or by one of many flexible servers who are capable of servicing all types of customers. The flexible servers are used only when the respective dedicated servers are all busy. A priority scheme is used to select the type of customer from the buffer when a flexible server is called for servicing the waiting customers. The processing times are assumed to be of phase type.

Arranged equipment, such as conveyors or machines, includes the need to model and determine motion paths for moving objects like forklifts or automatically guided vehicles, so that the simulation framework is able to navigate all vehicles across those motion paths. After analyzing first scenarios, the user often carries out layout changes in the simulation model, e.g. moving, adding or deleting equipment. However, those changes cause time consuming, additional modeling of the motion paths for the user.
Our motion planning algorithm reduces these changes by automatically determining the motion paths for moving objects, depending on an actual model layout without colliding with other objects. The algorithm works on the basis of the virtual scene’s 3D-data used for the simulation model’s visualization. We demonstrate the technique with a multi-floor building example.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/152.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Using Emulation To Debug Control Logic Code:  A Case Study</i><br />Bonnie Montalvo (E2M, Inc.) and Richard Phillips (Polytron, Inc.)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_334_9872" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_334_9872').hide();

However, instead of integrating the tool in the daily work of production engineers, companies apply it mostly in single-purpose studies such as major investment projects. One significant reason is the extensive time-consumption for input data management, which has to be performed for every simulation analysis to avoid making decisions based upon obsolete facts. This paper presents an approach that combines automated raw data collection and automated processing of raw data to simulation information. MTConnect is used for collection of raw data and the GDM-Tool is applied for data processing. The purpose is to enable efficient reuse of DES models by reducing the time-consumption for input data management. Furthermore, the approach is evaluated using production data from the aerospace industry.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/155.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Framework For Simulation-based Scheduling of Assembly Lines</i><br />Falk S.

On one hand there are several production specifics which aggravate solution finding. On the other hand different companies pursue different goals in planning and scheduling and even if they have similar production environments solutions usually need to be adapted specifically for them. A promising way of dealing with problems of this domain is simulation-based scheduling. In our paper, we introduce the architecture of a framework which is designed to aid in the creation of solutions for assembly line workforce scheduling. The framework combines a meta model to describe production networks and facilities with a completely modular design. Through the combination and reuse of exchangeable modules the framework offers the opportunity to focus on the development of optimization algorithms while supporting easy adaptation of solutions to different data and software infrastructures.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/156.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Estimating Clearing Functions from Empirical Data</i><br />N.

In an emulation, models of production lines are connected  to and controlled by the actual controls that run the line on the factory floor.  By doing this, the logic of the line is debugged much earlier in the process than normal, which provides myriad advantages.  The model will more accurately represent the real world and any work that is being done on the line - starting up a new line, im-proving production, changing machines - can be tested in a virtual setting to ensure functionality and improve upon safety and cost.

A successful live-system modernization depends on a rapid, predictable startup with no unmitigated risks. This is achieved through extensive testing prior to startup, which can not be performed while the system is in service.

During a project, engineers overcame the live system’s availability constraints by creating a software-based virtual system, emulating all control and feedback signals, operating speeds, constraints, and physical characteristics of the equipment. 

Twenty-one programmable controllers, a supervisory computer system, and four operator interface applications, all developed to operate the physical system, were connected to the model. All subsystems were brought online, and the system was run as a whole. 

All software, algorithm, control system, operator-interface, and factory-acceptance tests were performed in the model environment. The modernized system was brought online without disruption to any factory operations.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/159.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Machine Control Level Simulation of an AS/RS in The Automotive Industry</i><br />Minsuk Ko, Hyeseon Shin, Ginam Wang and Sangchul Park (Ajou University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_346_6134" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_346_6134').hide();

The case study is developed in order to simulate and verify the PLC control program for an automobile panel AS/RS. Because of increasing demand, the complexity of the supply system is rising in this industry. To cope with this problem, companies use AS/RS systems, despite inherent logical complexities. Industrial automated processes use PLC code to control the AS/RS; however, control information and the control code (PLC code) are difficult to understand. Therefore, this paper suggests a PLC simulation environment, using 3D models and PLC code, which consists of real automobile manufacturing data. Data used in this simulation is based on 3D and logical models, using actual size and PLC signals, respectively. The environment resembles a real factory; users can verify and test the PLC code using the simulation prior to implementation of AS/RS.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/160.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wednesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Optimizing Manufacturing Operations</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Karthik Vasudevan (Production Modeling Corporation)<br /></span><br /><i>Testing Line Optimization Based on Mathematical Modeling of the Metamodels Obtained from a Simulation</i><br />Roberto Seijo-Vidal and Sonia Bartolomei-Suarez (University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_348_511" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_348_511').hide();

Understanding this relationship allows to build mathematical expressions for the output variables which is the foundation for the optimization. Typical simulation optimization methods were not of practical value for this application. An optimization tool based on mathematical programming was developed.

a challenging problem in field development. Well placement problems are integer
optimization problems because a reservoir is discretized into grid blocks and the
well locations are defined by block indices in the discrete model. Reservoir simulators are used to evaluate reservoir production given a well placement. Under reservoir uncertainty, we simulate multiple model realizations to estimate the expected field performance for a certain well placement. 

We present a retrospective optimization (RO) algorithm that uses Hooke-Jeeves
search for well location optimization under uncertainty. The RO framework
generates a sequence of sample-path problems with increasing sample sizes.
Embedded in RO, the Hooke-Jeeves search solves each sample-path problem for a local optimizer. The numerical results show that the RO algorithm efficiently finds a solution yielding a 70% increase in the expected net present value over 30 years of reservoir production for the problem considered.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/162.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Utilising Dynamic Factory Simulation to Improve Unit Cost Estimation and Aid Design Decisions</i><br />Stuart Jinks, Jim Scanlan and Philippa Reed (University of Southampton) and Steve Wiseall (Rolls-Royce)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_352_700" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_352_700').hide();

Although Discrete Event Simulation Modeling (DESM) has some differences from classical software development, it is possible to draw a parallel between these techniques and DESM. This article reviews some of the metrics from software engineering, and, based on those, proposes a metric for estimating time for the implementation of a simulation model using one specific simulation software. The results obtained for 22 real simulation projects showed that the proposed technique can estimate the time for software development with acceptable accuracy (average error of 6% and maximum absolute error of 38%) for models that have less that 200 simulation objects.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/165.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="09 // LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Supply Chain Performance</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Nurcin Celik (University of Miami)<br /></span><br /><i>Dynamic Adjustment of Replenishment Parameters using Optimum-Seeking Simulation</i><br />Chandandeep Singh Grewal, Silvanus T.

huge detriments they might cause. Supply disruptions have various
forms, including machine breakdowns and natural disasters. As an
effective marketing tool, dynamic pricing has been helping sellers
enhance their profits. In addition, price-dependent demand is
common in practice. This paper studies a single-product inventory
system that consists of a supplier, a retailer, and customers. The
supplier is subject to disruptions. The retailer adopts a periodic
review inventory policy, under which an appropriate inventory
replenishment order is sent to the supplier at fixed intervals
of time. Price is adjusted according to inventory level at each
inventory review point. Customer demand variation based on price
is also considered. In this paper, we simulate the concerned
inventory system and investigate the impact of supply
disruptions, dynamic pricing, and price-sensitive demand on the
retailer's annual profit.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/168.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Using System Dynamics On Short Life Cycle Supply Chains Evaluation</i><br />Enrico Briano, Claudia Caballini, Pietro Giribone and Roberto Revetria (University of Genoa)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_362_7432" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_362_7432').hide();

We need to obtain good inventory policies quickly so that supply chain managers can run and analyze multiple scenarios effectively in reasonable amount of time. While simulation-based optimization approaches can be used, the time required to solve the inventory problem for a large number of products is prohibitive. On the other hand, available quick approximations are not guaranteed to provide satisfactory solutions. Our approach involves sampling the universe of products with different problem parameters, obtaining their optimal inventory policies via simulation-based optimization and then using regression methods to characterize the inventory policy for similar products.

The primary problem at hand is to model a complex supply chain involving blending of multiple inputs to produce a number of potential products for customers. The first approach involves solving an optimisation model to produce a long term plan, then simulating this plan over time without the ability to change the plan as time progresses.  The second approach involves a more integrated system where multiple instances of an optimisation model are run throughout the simulation using updated inputs. A description of the problem is supplied, providing the need for both optimisation and simulation, then the two case studies are compared to show the benefits of integrating the optimisation within the simulation model.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/176.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Optimization and Analysis of Staffing Problems at a Retail Store</i><br />Kanna Miwa and Soemon Takakuwa (Nagoya University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_376_3671" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_376_3671').hide();

With the objective of evaluating the value of GIS information, we develop a seaport operations model that simulates the decision making process associated with scheduling and processing of ships .  We consider three scenarios: (1) A traditional model where there is no GIS information on future arrivals; (2) Information about the next arriving ship is known; and (3) Information of all ships heading towards the port is known. We propose heuristics for the resulting optimization problems, determine the value of information, and tabulate how that varies with various operational parameters. Adding such operational intelligence to shipping operations significantly improves (by as much as 15% and by 7% on average) the performance without expanding the physical footprint of the seaport.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/182.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Automated Stowage Planning for Large Containership with Improved Safety and Stability</i><br />Min Zeng, Malcolm Yoke Hean Low, Wenjing Hsu, Shell Ying Huang, Fan Liu and Cho Aye Win (Nanyang Technological University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_388_9605" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_388_9605').hide();

As the size of containership increases, generating a stowage plan with good safety and stability for a large containership becomes increasingly difficult. In this paper, we present an automated stowage planning system for large containerships which consists of three modules: the stowage plan generator, the safety and stability adjustment module, and the optimization engine. This paper focuses on the safety and stability adjustment module which resolves the stability issues of a stowage plan by adjusting the distribution of container weights by stowing containers in alternative feasible locations and fine-tuning stability parameters through adjusting the ballast in tanks onboard. Using shipping data for a large 7000 TEUs containership on a multi-port voyage, we demonstrate that our system can generate stowage plans with improved safety and stability compared to those generated by experienced planners.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/183.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Matching Production Planning and Ship Arrival Scheduling by Simulation</i><br />Marcelo Moretti Fioroni, Luiz Augusto G.

As a consequence, the associated logistics networks have reached unprecedented complexity: Component exchange commitments are now made to multiple operators, not only at their main bases but also at outstations. In this setting, the limitations of conventional Initial Provisioning methods can be overcome with high-fidelity simulation-based optimisation techniques. In particular, this paper discusses how value can be unlocked from new logistics policies for spare parts management in aviation.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/188.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Simulation-based control for green transportation with high delivery service</i><br />Seokgi Lee and Vittal Prabhu (Pennsylvania State University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_400_9429" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_400_9429').hide();

Furthermore, responsiveness to customer demand requires rapid generation of good quality solutions. This paper presents a simulation-based feedback control algorithm for real-time vehicle route planning which considers delivery timeliness and fuel efficiency. The proposed control theoretic algorithm uses feedback from simulation to adjust the planned routes for timeliness and adaptively adjust the vehicle speed within an allowable range to improve fuel efficiency. The formulation results in a multi-variable continuous variable control system with non-linear dynamics.

Real-time information systems for travelers and facility managers are one approach that has been the focus of many recent efforts. Real-time performance information can facilitate more efficient roadway usage and operations. Toward this end, a dynamic data driven simulation based system for estimating and predicting performance measures along arterial streets in real-time is described that uses microscopic traffic simulations, driven by point sensor data.  Current practices of real-time estimation of roadway performance measures are reviewed. The proposed real-time data driven arterial simulation methodology to estimate performance measures along arterials is presented as well as preliminary field results that provide evidence to validate this approach.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/190.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Warehousing</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Mamadou Seck (TU Delft)<br /></span><br /><i>Aggregate Modeling for Flow Time Prediction of an End-Of-Aisle Order Picking Workstation with Overtaking</i><br />Ricky Andriansyah, Pascal Etman and Jacobus Rooda (Eindhoven University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_404_2923" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_404_2923').hide();

Experimental results show that the predicted flow time distributions are accurate, with prediction errors of the flow time mean and squared coefficient of variation less than 4% and 9%, respectively.

In this paper, a systematic and flexible procedure is proposed that efficiently provides critical decision-making support to logistics managers to help them understand and validate the material handling operation at a real retail-cross-docking center. The proposed procedure considers dynamic logistics operation information, such as inbound schedules of suppliers, demand data from retail-chain stores, and individual operator schedules. This detailed data is required for the performance of simulation. In addition, the procedure is applied to an actual non-automated retail-cross-docking center to confirm its effectiveness.

Efficient computational tools are needed to perform this activity in a reliable and cost-effective manner. This work presents a novel discrete event simulation system developed on Arena® for the detailed scheduling of a multiproduct pipeline consisting of a sequence of pipes that connect a single input station to several receiving terminals. The pipeline is modeled as a non-traditional multi-server queuing system involving a number of servers at every pipe-end that perform their tasks in a synchronized manner. Based on priority rules, the model decides which server should dispatch the entity waiting for service to the associated depot. Each priority rule can lead to a different delivery schedule, which is evaluated by using several criteria. Combined with optimization tools, the proposed simulation technique permits to easily manage real-world pipelines operations with low computational effort.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/194.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Simulation Model to Evaluate Sugarcane Supply Systems</i><br />Joao Rangel (Candido Mendes University), Andre Cunha (Peugeot Citroën do Brasil Automóveis Ltda) and Leandro Azevedo and Dalessandro Vianna (Candido Mendes University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_410_4725" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_410_4725').hide();

To successfully support
detailed design and operation, a microscopic rail network model is often deemed not only suitable but also mandatory. However, the simulation of large-scale microscopic models is computationally intensive, making it unsuitable for
real-time applications. In this paper, a railway simulation library, LIBROS-II, is introduced which offers high performance rail simulation at the microscopic level. The library is specified with the DEVS formalism. Its major components and their specifications are presented. Its performance is assessed through a simple example and contrasted with a typical model using a continuous modeling abstraction of train movement. The result shows that with comparable model detail and accuracy the LIBROS-II model yields a higher performance than the model using differential equations.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/198.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>An Approach for Loosely Coupled Discrete Event Simulation Models and Animation Components</i><br />Michele Fumarola, Mamadou Seck and Alexander Verbraeck (Delft University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_418_9359" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_418_9359').hide();

Including animation in a simulation model, often results in models that contain many references to animation specific code. Moreover, in the specific case of discrete event simulation, challenges arise due to the difference in time-bases with animation techniques that mostly have a discrete notion of time. Typical approaches to developing animation for simulation models provide tightly coupled simulation and animation components that are fine-tuned to provide acceptable results. Apart of the disadvantage of having entangled model and animation code, this also has the disadvantage of reduced flexibility that one would desire in order to be able to use other animation techniques: for instance going from 2D to 3D with modern visualization libraries. In this paper, we will present our approach for loosely coupled discrete event simulation models and animation components.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/199.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="10 // HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Planning for Contagious Disease</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Steve Roberts (Noth Carolina State University)<br /></span><br /><i>Planning for Infectious Disease Outbreaks: A Geographic Disease Spread, Clinic Location, and Resource Allocation Simulation</i><br />Sean Carr and Stephen D.

In this research, we have created a simulation of the disease spread process employing a SEIR compartmental model. The model includes employment patterns and separates the population into age groups and spatial location to more accurately describe disease spread behavior. 

The analysis involves measuring health-related performance as we change the number of days elapsing between clinic days. We open clinics in locations that maximize the infected population coverage subject to budget and resource-related constraints, using a MIP location-allocation model.

An example case is provided in the context of an outbreak occurring in Wake County, NC.

In areas where healthcare is easily available to the general public (specifically, countries with universal healthcare), the ability of infected individuals to receive rapid treatment should impact disease spread. Additionally, the presence of a pandemic will result in an increased load on the healthcare system as infected individuals seek medical attention at hospitals and from their family doctors. We modify an existing non-homogeneous, agent-based simulation pandemic disease spread model to incorporate a public healthcare system in a pandemic influenza simulation on the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. Results show that healthcare availability significantly significantly increases disease spread due to increased contacts within the population. We also find that the creation of flu centers decreases flu-related deaths and decreases hospital admissions.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/205.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Epidemics and Agents</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Sheldon H.

Analytical solutions to more realistic models, on the other hand, are often difficult or impossible to derive even for simple cases, which restricts application of such models. We develop an agent-based simulation model of epidemics, and apply response-surface methodology to seek an optimum for the RA output in an iterative procedure. Validation is demonstrated through comparison of the results with the mathematical solution in an RA example for which the analytical solution is known. We apply the proposed approach to a more complicated RA problem in which a number of previous restricting assumptions are relaxed.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/206.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Dynamic Patient Network Model of Hospital-Acquired Infections</i><br />Sean Barnes and Bruce Golden (University of Maryland) and Edward Wasil (American University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_434_8243" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_434_8243').hide();

Patients who share a health care worker (HCW) are inherently connected to each other and those connections form a network through which transmission can occur.  The structure of such networks can be a strong determinant of the extent and rate of transmission.  We first examine how the density of the patient network affects transmission.  Our experiments demonstrate that nurses are responsible for spreading more infection because they typically visit patients more often.  However, doctors also pose a serious threat because their patient networks are more highly connected, which creates more opportunity for transmission to spread to multiple cohorts in the unit.  We also explore the effects of patient sharing among HCWs, which temporarily alters the structure of the patient network.  Our results suggest that this practice should be done in a structured manner to minimize additional transmission.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/207.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Modeling Interruptions and Patient Flow in a Preoperative Hospital Environment</i><br />Kevin Taaffe and Narges Hosseini (Clemson University), Nathan Huynh (University of South Carolina), Bryan Pearce (Clemson University) and Shannon Harris (Greenville Hospital System)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_436_844" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_436_844').hide();

A novel discrete event modeling paradigm has been adopted for simulating the complex behavior of the preoperative system, identifying the underlying causes of process inefficiencies, and testing mitigating strategies.

It is evident that healthcare systems are rapidly evolving into complex and dynamic environments whilst bearing a multitude of stakeholders. Simulation has originally emerged from military and manufacturing applications that mainly follow sequential processing with pre-specified targets.  Such an approach is too rigid and irrelevant to the complexity and dynamism of healthcare systems, where lack of understanding is a common feature. This is mainly attributed to lack of understating of the life cycle of healthcare services. In this paper we attempt to define the life cycle of healthcare services and explore the use of modeling and simulation in supporting healthcare service development and management.  We particularly explore a number of exemplars of how modeling was used to support earlier stages of the service life cycle.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/209.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Economics of Modeling and Simulation: Reflections and Implications for Healthcare</i><br />Simon Taylor, Mohsen Jahangirian and Terry Young (Brunel University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_440_778" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_440_778').hide();

In this paper we consider some of the reasons for this and describe two practical healthcare examples of combined DES/SD models, which nevertheless fall short of the “holy grail” which has been so widely discussed in the literature over the past decade.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/211.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Healthcare Engineering</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: John Fowler (Arizona State University)<br /></span><br /><i>Modeling Care Teams at the Mayo Clinic</i><br />Thomas R Rohleder, Todd R Huschka, Jason Egginton, Daniel O&apos;Neil and Naomi Woychick (Mayo Clinic)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_444_9706" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_444_9706').hide();

One of these consequences is ambulance diversion (AD), which is adopted as a solution to relieve congestion. This paper develops a simulation model for ED to study the impact of AD policies based on one of the following main ED state variables: the number of patients waiting, the number of patients boarding and the number of available beds in the inpatient unit. The objective is to analyze the impact of AD on the ED performance considering two criteria: patient average waiting time and percentage of time spent on diversion. Results show that there exist significant differences based on the variables chosen to design the policy. This insight can assist to ED managers in making AD decisions to achieve better quality of healthcare service.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/213.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Integrated Agent-Oriented Modeling and Simulation of Population and Healthcare Delivery Network: Application to COPD Chronic Disease in a Canadian Region</i><br />Moez Charfeddine and Benoit Montreuil (Laval University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_448_3244" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_448_3244').hide();

In this framework exploiting agent oriented modeling, demand for healthcare is expressed deeply through the stochastic modeling of health status evolution of each person in a population of potential patients, where the implications of this evolution generate the demand in terms of patient needs for healthcare and their frequency. In parallel, the organization and functioning of the healthcare delivery network is mod-eled with an adequate detail level.

This paper presents a methodology that integrates BSC and simulation modeling to improve the performance of ED in a University Hospital in North Dublin. BSC design began with understanding patient’s needs, ED activities, as well as training and development programs. Then a detailed simulation model was developed and integrated with the BSC to provide a comprehensive decision support system.

We develop a simulation model to compare a flexible and a focused resource-allocation policy. We evaluate these two policies on patient and provider outcome measures, including patient wait time and physician overtime. We find that the focused policy results in lower elective wait time and lower overtime, which leads to the conclusion that electives benefit more from the elimination of emergency disruptions than what they lose from the reduced access to operating rooms. Emergency patient wait time, however, increases significantly as we shift from the flexible to the focused policy. The sensitivity analysis showed that average emergency wait time can decrease as the processing time variability increases. The trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness calls for additional research on other operating-room-allocation policies.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/217.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Operating Room and Scheduling</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Julie Ivy (North Carolina State University)<br /></span><br /><i>Delay Predictors for Customer Service Systems with Time-Varying Parameters</i><br />Rouba Ibrahim (University of Montreal) and Ward Whitt (Columbia University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_456_5039" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_456_5039').hide();

systems, we develop new real-time delay predictors that effectively
cope with customer abandonment and time-varying parameters. First,
we focus on delay predictors exploiting recent customer delay
history. We show that time-varying arrival rates can introduce
significant prediction bias in delay-history-based predictors when
the system experiences alternating periods of overload and
underload. We then introduce a new delay-history-based predictor
that effectively copes with time-varying arrival rates. Second, we
consider a time-varying number of servers. We develop two new
predictors which exploit an established deterministic fluid
approximation for a many-server queueing model with time-varying
demand and capacity. The new predictors effectively cope with those

Further, inpatient admissions has a significant impact on the hospital's profitability, access, and quality of care. Making effective decisions to drive high quality, efficient hospital behavior is difficult, if not impossible, without the aid of sophisticated decision support. Hancock and Walter (1983) developed such a management system with documented implementation success, but for each hospital the system parameters are "optimized" manually. We present a framework for valuing instances of this management system via simulation and optimizing the system parameters using a genetic algorithm based search. This approach reduces the manual overhead in designing a hospital management system and enables the creation of Pareto efficiency curves to better inform management of the trade-offs between critical hospital metrics when designing a new control system.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/219.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>A Stochastic Control Approach to Avoiding Emergency Department Overcrowding</i><br />Arun Chockalingam, Krishna Jayakumar and Mark A Lawley (Purdue University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_460_8607" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_460_8607').hide();

Presenting a barrier to safe delivery of healthcare, hospitals address ED overcrowding by diverting ambulances to the nearest available facility, leading to delays in healthcare delivery and losses in revenue. Control policies on hospital resources could greatly improve healthcare delivery by preventing overcrowding and ambulance diversion. In this paper, we use Petri-nets (PNs) to model patient and resource flow in a hospital system. Simulating these PNs, we can observe changes in the availability of resources over time and obtain a stochastic differential equation (SDE) which models the hospital’s proximity to entering a divert state (in a Euclidean sense). Likening the resource allocation problem to a stochastic control problem, we derive the related free-boundary problem. The solution of this problem is the optimal control policy that dictates when and how many resources should be added or removed.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/220.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wednesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Public and Community Health</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Sada Soorapanth (San Francisco State University)<br /></span><br /><i>Modeling and Simulation of Teachers Occupational Stress Diffusion in China</i><br />Tianyin Liu and Bin Hu (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_462_708" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_462_708').hide();

The ODE model maps measurements of behavioral risk reduction parameters, estimated from sampling, into costs and QALYs. Monte Carlo sampling was used to perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to quantify uncertainty in costs and QALYs due to parameter estimation error from sampling. The results suggested that the behavioral interventions considered in this study are most likely to be cost-saving, or at least cost-effective. Our study shows how statistical estimates of behavioral measures translates into uncertainty about health costs and outcomes and suggests implications for which data are important to collect when assessing cost-utility tradeoffs, and not just measures of risk reduction from behavioral interventions.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/223.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wednesday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Clinical Performance</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Terry Young (Brunel University)<br /></span><br /><i>A Revenue Management Approach for Managing Operating Room Capacity</i><br />Alia C Stanciu (Bucknell University) and Luis G Vargas and Jerrold H May (University of Pittsburgh)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_468_1705" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_468_1705').hide();

An important question for the hospital management is: What is the lowest number of additional resources that would be needed in the ED, due to the patient volume increase, which would not compromise the patient flow? This is evaluated through various scenarios of discrete event simulation models.

Typically, the bottleneck of such facilities is the photolithography area because of its highly expensive tools and complex resource constraints. In this research, a multistage mixed integer programming based optimization approach for planning of such an area is presented. Thereby, several existing process constraints like equipment dedications, resist allocation, vertical dedications, mask availability are taken into account on the basis of different granularity levels. Altogether eleven different optimization models are presented within four different decomposition stages. Thereby, objected goals are the maximization of throughput, the minimization of setup costs and a balancing of machine utilization. On the basis of real manufacturing data the benefit of the proposed approach is evaluated within a first prototype.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/227.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Machine Qualification Management for a Semiconductor Back-end Facility</i><br />John W.

Control Table which contains current WIP information of downstream
toolgroups such as target WIP, actual WIP and WIP difference. In
case of lot move in/out and tool status change, the WIP Control
Table is updated. Therefore, the upstream toolgroup is able to
detect WIP distribution and pull request of downstream toolgroups
dynamically, then push optimal lots with consideration of lot status
and local tool constraint to the downstream toolgroup which runs
short of WIP. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed

A detailed simulation model of the manufacturing system that can predict the cycle time distribution may be helpful in performance improvement activities, but requires considerable development and maintenance effort. To reduce development and maintenance effort, an aggregate model has recently
been developed that is a lumped-parameter representation of a manufacturing workstation. The lumped-parameters are directly determined from arrival and departure events measured at the workstation in operation. In this paper, we
investigate under which conditions the previously developed aggregate model can be used to model a re-entrant flow line of workstations, motivated by semiconductor manufacturing. We find that the range of throughput levels for
which accurate cycle time predictions are obtained increases for increasing process time variability, and decreases for increasing network size.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/234.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wafer Fab Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: John Fowler (Arizona State University)<br /></span><br /><i>A Discussion of Object-Oriented Process Modeling Approaches for Discrete Manufacturing on the Example of the Semiconductor Industry</i><br />Hans Ehm, Stefan Heilmayer, Thomas Ponsignon and Tim Russland (Infineon Technologies AG)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_490_7174" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_490_7174').hide();

In this paper, we discuss some important modelling issues associated with building an online simulation model. Key elements considered are actual process routes, process and throughput modelling as a function of equipment behavior, lot size, and available processing modules, process dedication at equipment level, equipment downs at mainframe level, estimated lot release strategy, send ahead wafers, dispatch rules, and setup. Typical application areas are proactive dedication management, preventive maintenance scheduling and WIP based sampling optimization.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/236.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>AMHS Factors Enabling Small Wafer Lot Manufacturing In Semiconductor Wafer FABS</i><br />Jesus Jimenez, Michael Bell, Charitha Adikaram and Victoria Davila (Texas State University) and Robert Wright and Alexander Grosser (International SEMATECH Manufacturing Initiative)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_494_9069" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_494_9069').hide();

In this paper, AMHS productivity detractors affecting small lot manufacturing are studied, including the track layout, number of vehicles, empty vehicle management rules, number of stockers, stocker capacity, among others. Linked simulation models were developed for the 12-wafer-lot and the 25-wafer-lot systems, using AutoSched AP to simulate wafer processing and AutoMod to simulate the AMHS. The AMHS productivity detractors under study were varied for experimental purposes, and each scenario was quantitatively analyzed by comparing delivery time, number of moves per hour, stocker load, and vehicle utilization. Changes in the factory logistics resulted in less congestion around high-throughput areas and faster AMHS delivery speeds. Simulation results showed improved AMHS performance despite the significant increase in the amount of wafer moves per hour caused by 12-wafer-lot manufacturing.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/237.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Equipment Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Hans Ehm (Infineon Technologies AG)<br /></span><br /><i>Performance Improvement For A Wet Bench Tool</i><br />Kamil Erkan Kabak and Cathal Heavey (University of Limerick) and Vincent Corbett (Analog Devices)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_496_1024" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_496_1024').hide();

Since Semiconductor Manufacturing is a highly capital intensive industry, it is crucial to optimize the usage of the resources. Performing preventive maintenance (PM), if done optimally, can reduce the risk of unpredicted failures and hence minimize the cost of outages. However, performing frequent PM results in higher cycle time and WIP accumulation at the toolset. In this paper we present a method to create optimal policies for a single-server single-product workstation using a Markov Decision Process model. The optimal policy determines whether or not to perform the PM based on the WIP level and the time since last repair. We present some numerical examples to illustrate the behavior of the optimal policy under different scenarios and compare the results with some common policies such as fixed frequency PM.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/239.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>The Impact of Operation-to-Tool Dedications on Factory Stability</i><br />James P.

Performance, in turn, is typically measured by average cycle time, capacity, yield, and cost. One metric of particular importance is, however, seldom considered. This is that of the stability of the machines, workstations, and production line as a whole. While too often ignored, it is vital that the components of the factory exhibit stable performance when exposed to everyday changes (e.g., minor fluctuations in product mix, slight changes in factory throughput). We examine, herein, the stability of the reentrant workstations that em-ploy operation-to-machine dedications when those dedications are produced by either (a) optimization, (b) heuristics, or (c) genetic algorithms. The results of a multi-year effort reveal there is a significant dif-ference in the stability of the resultant facility.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/240.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="12 // RISK ANALYSIS"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">RISK ANALYSIS</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Risk Assessment via Simulation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Pirooz Vakili (Boston University)<br /></span><br /><i>A Two-Level Loan Portfolio Optimization Problem</i><br />JianQiang Hu and Jun Tong (Fudan University), Tie Liu and Rong Zeng Cao (IBM Research - China) and Bo Yang (Industrial Bank Co., LTD.)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_502_6163" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_502_6163').hide();

R&S via simulation is particularly appealing as it combines
modeling flexibility of simulation with the efficiency of statistical techniques for effective decision making. The overwhelming majority of the R&S research, however, focuses on the expected performance of competing designs.
Alternatively, quantiles, which provide additional information about the distribution of the performance measure of interest, may serve as better risk measures than the usual expected value. In stochastic systems, quantiles indicate
the level of system performance that can be delivered with a specified probability. In this paper, we address the problem of ranking and selection based on quantiles.

These risk contributions play an important role in risk management of credit portfolios. They can be used to measure profitability and allocate capital. Mathematically, it turns out that risk contributions can be represented as conditional expectations. However, simulating risk contributions is a computationally challenging problem, due to the general difficulty of estimating conditional expectation as well as the rare event feature of portfolio credit risk. In this paper, we devise an importance sampling(IS) method for simulating risk contributions by exploring the conditional-independence structure of credit portfolio modeling. The IS estimator proposed has a faster convergence rate than the available methods. It helps to reduce not only the variance, but more importantly, the bias. Numerical experiments show that the IS estimator performs very well.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/256.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Simulation on Demand for Pricing Many Securities</i><br />Ming Liu, Barry L.

Increasing transmission power reduces battery life and increases susceptibility to eavesdropping.  Adding stationary repeater nodes is impractical for highly mobile users in dangerous environments. Using remotely-controlled mobile relay nodes requires centralized control schemes which and adds network traffic overhead and introduces a single point of failure at the controller.

An alternative is to create a Mobile Agent Relay Network (MARN). Each autonomous node in the MARN is an agent that decides where to move to maintain the network connectivity using only locally available information from onboard sensors and communication with in-range neighbor nodes.  MARN agents form and maintain a communication network that provides connectivity for users while reducing the overall radio frequency footprint, minimizing the likelihood of detection and eavesdropping. We characterize the footprint reduction both theoretically and in simulation.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/262.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Streaming Workload Generator for Testing Billing Mediation Platform in Telecom Industry</i><br />Eric Bouillet and Parijat Dube (IBM)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_544_7566" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_544_7566').hide();

The comprehensive records generated by BMPs can be used for billing purposes, but also fraud detection, campaign management, spam filtering, traffic analysis, and churn predicition. Many of these applications are characterized by real-time processing requiring high throughput, low-latency analysis of CDRs.
Testing such BMPs has different dimensions, stress testing of analytics for scalability, correctness of analytics, what-if scenarios, all of which require CDRs with realistic volumetric and contextual properties. We propose a framework for testing and benchmarking BMPs which involves generating high volumes of CDRs representative of real-world data. The framework is flexible in its ability to express and tune the workload generation to simulate CDRs from broad range of traffic patterns while preserving different spatio-temporal correlations and content-level information observed in real-world CDRs.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/263.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Does the Erlang C Model Fit in Real Call Centers?</i><br />Thomas Robbins (East Carolina University) and D.

Erlang C is a simple model that ignores caller abandonment and is the model most commonly used by practitioners and researchers.  We compare the theoretical performance predictions of the Erlang C model to a call center simulation model where many of the Erlang C assumptions are relaxed.   Our findings indicate that the Erlang C model is subject to significant error in predicting system performance, but that these errors are heavily biased and most likely to be pessimistic, i.e. the system tends to perform better than predicted.  It may be the case that the model’s tendency to provide pessimistic (i.e. conservative) estimates helps explain its continued popularity.  Prediction error is strongly correlated with the abandonment rate so the model works best in call centers with large numbers of agents and relatively low utilization rates.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/264.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 10:30 A.M. - 12:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Cyber Security and Vulnerability</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Angel A.

The premise is that intelligent agents can use such predictions to form context-aware, cognitive processes for managing communication in mobile networks. Network management is improved through the use of context-awareness, which is provided through rough long or mid-term plans of operation and short-term predictions of network state and congestion levels. Research into incorporating an intelligent awareness of the network state enables a middleware platform to better react to current conditions. Simulations illustrate the advantages of this techniques when compared to traditional mobile network protocols, where the general assumption is that nothing is known about the mobility or communication patterns of the mobile entities and the network is often treated as an opaque black box. Our approach shows promise for improved network management.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/271.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Fast Simulation of Background Traffic through Fair Queueing Networks</i><br />Dong Jin and David Nicol (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_558_4949" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_558_4949').hide();

Since the generation and movement of background traffic in a network simulation
represents so much of the workload, we develop here techniques for modeling background traffic through switches that use Fair Queueing scheduling.  Our work is an extension of earlier efforts that assumed all switches use First-Come-First-Serve scheduling.  It turns out the the scheduling policy has an important impact on the logic of the earlier technique, and on the performance it delivers.

RISE uses Service-Oriented RESTful web-services, and it is based on three aspects: the framework architecture, the modeling level and the simulation synchronization level. RISE is independent of any simulation engine, theory or an algorithm. However, it provides different rules for simulation domains with conservative or optimistic synchronization algorithms. Further, RISE does not require any implementation changes related to domain modeling or simulation methods.

In this paper we describe an approach that uses delegate MultiAgent Systems to reduce the complexity of such symbiotic relationships.

We present the first implementation of a well-known vehicle mobility model to ns-3, the next generation of the popular ns-2 networking simulator. Vehicle mobility and network communication are integrated through events. User-created event handlers can send network messages or alter vehicle mobility each time a network message is received and each time vehicle mobility is updated by the model. To aid in creating simulations, we have implemented a straight highway model that manages vehicle mobility, while allowing for various user customizations. We show that the results of our implementation of the mobility model matches that of the model’s author and provide an example of using our implementation in ns-3.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/277.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Discrete Event Simulation Model For Analysis of Horizontal Scaling in the Cloud Computing Model</i><br />Joseph Idziorek (Iowa State University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_570_1281" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_570_1281').hide();

This paper describes a discrete event simulation model that is used to explore the relationship between the horizontal scaling profile configurations and the functionality of the cloud model.  Initial results show that both a state-aware load distribution algorithm and the parameters that dictate the elasticity of the horizontal scaling ability are essential to achieving high rates of utilization.

Most other planning techniques are either aimed at specialized types of construction work (such as linear scheduling) or are peripheral tools to be used conjunctively (such as nD-CAD).  Discrete-event simulation has also been used for construction planning, and while it is extremely versatile, it lacks the simplicity in use of CPM and so has not been widely adopted within the industry.  This paper goes back to first principles, identifying the needs of construction project planning and how existing tools meet (or fail to meet) these requirements.  Based on this, it proposes a new modeling paradigm, Foresight, better suited to contemporary construction project planning.  The principles of the method and its relative merits are demonstrated relative to conventional simulation in a series of construction case studies.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/279.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Clustered Simulation for the Simulation of Large Repetitive Construction Projects</i><br />Amr Kandil (Purdue University), Ahmed Samer Ezeldin (American University in Cairo), Sherif Farghal (Pyramid Consulting International) and Tarek Mahfouz (Ball State University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_574_3287" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_574_3287').hide();

Construction simulation modeling is one of the later stages of this evolution that has received much attention in research. Many simulation based construction planning methods developed modeling methods that attempt to cluster project activities into smaller sub-models that enhance model reusability. Many of these modeling methods, however, create new modeling elements  that are not familiar to traditional construction simulation modelers. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a method for clustering activities of large and repetitive construction projects for enhancing the reusability of those simulation models. The developed method does not create any new modeling elements and is called Clustered Simulation Modeling (CSM). CSM was evaluated in modeling an actual large-scale repetitive construction projects, and the results have illustrated the effectiveness of the method and the proposed clustering scheme.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/280.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Derivation and Assessment of Interest in Cash Flow Calculations for Time-Cost Optimizations in Construction Project Management</i><br />Gunnar Lucko and Richard Thompson (Catholic University of America)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_576_124" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_576_124').hide();

For planning purposes, most models assign costs at the activity level, as individual transactions at their actual date of occurrence as yet unknown. The interplay of cash outflows from numerous purchases, salaries, and payments for materials, labor, and equipment and regular cash inflows from progress payments by the owner to the contractor create a characteristic ‘sawtooth’ pattern. However, interest calculations for such continuously changing balances traditionally used averaging approximations that deviate from the exact solution. The derivation for such financing fee is presented and its logarithmic expression is compared with the approximations. It is concluded that more detailed research is merited as to how assuming a linearization used in manifold examples of cash flow analysis matches with practice.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/281.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Integrating Simulation Research and Construction Pedagogy</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: John Taylor (Columbia University)<br /></span><br /><i>Integrating Simulation into the Research and Teaching of Construction Engineering and Management: Reflections on Experience</i><br />David Ford (Texas A&M University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_578_188" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_578_188').hide();

This paper presents the results of five years of experience integrating simulation research on project networks into project management courses.  Initial attempts to integrate research-oriented computational simulation models met with limited success.  An intermediary set of in-class exercises and a simplified web-based version of the project network simulation were created to expose students to the impact of network structure on adaptation performance.  This strengthened comprehension by the students.  However, it also led to an iterative expansion of the research from a narrow focus on network relational stability to include designs focused on cultural and linguistic differences, retention loss and opportunistic behavior.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/284.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Challenges in Representation and Reasoning of Domain Knowledge</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Amlan Mukherjee (Michigan Technological University)<br /></span><br /><i>Identification of Information Requirements Using Simulation for Supporting Construction Productivity Assessment</i><br />Seyed Mohsen Shahandashti, Burcu Akinci, James H.

A prototype to test the proposed framework for the identification of information requirements by studying the assessment of earthmoving productivity is introduced.  Based on literature regarding the factors that can affect earthmoving productivity, several scenarios, representing different factors that affect earthmoving productivity, have been created and studied. These scenarios have been simulated to help to identify the information items required for assessing earthmoving productivity, such as hauling distance and loading time.

To avoid the high cost in direct data collection and the difficulties in studying single decision impacts, we present an alternative to study and optimize decision strategies. Interactive Construction Decision Making Aid (ICDMA) is an interactive simulator which allows users to implement different decision strategies on the defined projects. All the project information and decision data in the simulation are recorded electronically. We started with five candidate strategies and analyzed data for general patterns. New hybrid strategies were generated based on the data analysis.

This paper presents a robust and general-purpose mobile computing framework that allows users to readily create complex AR visual simulations. The technical challenges of building this framework from the software and hardware perspective are described. SMART is a generic and loosely-coupled software architecture for creating AR visual simulations with accurate registration and projection algorithms. ARMOR is a modular mobile hardware platform designed for user position and orientation tracking and augmented view display. Together, SMART and ARMOR allow the creation of complex AR visual simu-lations.

Unfortunately, the complexity and sophistication involved in the model development and experimentation phases deters their participation. This also makes the validation problem particularly challenging, and hinders the credibility and successful deployment of such models. In addressing this problem, we introduce an interactive simulation platform called Interactive Construction Decision Making Aid (ICDMA), that integrates decision-maker participation into the model development, simulation deployment, experimentation and validation phases. Effectively it separates the complexities of programming the model, and the model development process, thus encouraging the participation of domain experts.

The latter has the proven potential to radically reduce the time, cost, and skills of creating complex models by using process templates from which models for construction applications can be rapidly deployed.

While differences in occupant energy usage characteristics play an important role in this variation, actual energy estimation software do not account for this social behavioral factor. This paper proposes a new approach for energy estimation in buildings using a combination of traditional energy calculation software along with agent based simulation modeling. First, the difference in energy consumption levels for different types of occupancy behavior is identified by building energy models adapted for each type of behavior. Then, an agent based simulation model simulates the influence that people with different behaviors have on each other, resulting in potential changes in energy usage characteristics over time. By combining these two methods, more customized energy studies can be performed resulting in more accurate energy consumption estimates.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/291.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Sustainability and Socio-Enviro-Technical Systems: Modeling Total Cost of Ownership in Capital Facilities</i><br />Annie R.

This paper describes a agent-based  model of the Total Cost of Ownership of green facilities that can be applied at the earliest stages of concept development. An agent-based modeling approach captures the social, environmental, and engineering systems that characterize a facility’s life cycle cost and permits evaluating the impact of the institutional and industry environment on facility design and life cycle performance.

For a more complex project, 3D CAD models will help decision makers to improve integrity between design and construction process simulation, and process visualization will help them to detect deficiencies during the construction phase. High Level Architecture-based distributed simulation as a new simulation technique in construction facilitates integration and collaboration among various simulation models and allows us to standardize the integration process for computer software. It therefore enables us to integrate CAD models and 3D animation to visually control as-planned and as-built information. This paper proposes a methodology to integrate 3D modeling and visualization techniques with the tunneling construction simulation. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is validated in a real-life tunnel project in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/295.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Construction Logistics Planning By Simulation</i><br />Julia Voigtmann and Hans-Joachim Bargstädt (Bauhaus-Universität Weimar)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_604_5784" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_604_5784').hide();

Good construction logistics on construction sites saves time and con-struction costs. To plan construction logistics, numerous interferences between configuration of construc-tion site and construction work has to be considered. In particular in outfitting processes, their countless possible work sequences and many involved companies govern production logistics. This complex system can be analyzed by simulation.
Nevertheless logistic systems on sites are influenced by so various factors, that appointment of an op-timal network configuration and organisational structure becomes not trivial. To find a useable solution requires countless simulation runs with many factor variations. Therefore an adequate simulation model, which enables network dimensioning and analysing organisational structure of logistic processes without programming, is essential. Furthermore identification of qualified factor combinations depending on sev-eral process or building attributes and elimination of irrelevant factors accelerate logistic planning.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/296.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Resource Scheduling and Optimization</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Jin-Lee Kim (California State University Long Beach)<br /></span><br /><i>Integrated Genetic Algorithm and its Applications for Construction Resource Optimization</i><br />Jin-Lee Kim (California State University Long Beach)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_606_2315" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_606_2315').hide();

Recently, the integrated genetic algorithm rather than the stand-alone GA is being increasingly applied to solve the problems. An adaptive hybrid genetic algorithm search simulator (AHGASS) for resource scheduling problems has been developed in the previous stage of this research. Previous work outlined the strategies and practical procedures for the algorithm development, but did not deal with algorithm performance with regard to algorithm runtime, especially against runtime used in generating optimality. Since the major drawback of using GA is a great length of time required, it is meaningful to investigate the significance in algorithm runtime between AHGASS and optimality. To address this issue, this paper attempts to investigate the difference in algorithm performance with regard to algorithm runtime.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/297.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Examining the Relationship between Algorithm Stopping Criteria and Performance using Elitist Genetic Algorithm</i><br />Jin-Lee Kim (California State University Long Beach)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_608_9847" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_608_9847').hide();

Thus, it is necessary to identify the tradeoff between the algorithm stopping criteria and the algorithm performance.  As an effort of determining the tradeoff, this paper examines the relationship between the algorithm performance and algorithm stopping criteria.  Two algorithm stopping criteria, such as the different numbers of unique schedules and the number of generation, are used, while existing studies employ the number of generation as a sole stopping condition.  Elitist genetic algorithm is used to solve 30 projects having 30-Activity with four renewable resources for statistical analysis.  The relationships are presented by comparing means for algorithm performance measures, which include the fitness values, total algorithm runtime in millisecond, and the flatline starting generation number.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/298.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Simulation-based Workforce Assignment Considering Position in a Social Network</i><br />Nurcin Celik, Hui Xi, Dong Xu and Young-Jun Son (University of Arizona)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_610_4276" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_610_4276').hide();

The proposed framework is composed of the evaluation module, an agent-based simulation model representing the considered social network; and the assignment module, a multi-objective optimization model.  The Decision Evolution Procedure of the evaluation module first calculates the position values between each pair of available workforce.  Using these position values, the Extended Regular Equivalence Evaluation algorithm of the evaluation module then computes the regular and structural equivalence values between each pair of workforce.  Finally, the assignment module selects the optimal workforce mix maximizing both the short (productivity) and long-term performance (robustness) of the organization.

Modern simulation tools can be applied with increasing success. Projects are often affected by unscheduled constraints and limitations that give reason to deviate from the formerly optimized plan and to find ad-hoc solutions, especially in the erection phase.
In order to meet these requirements, simulation tools in the erection phase with a more specific database is needed. An approach based on accurate day-to-day data for the current project state at any time is needed. These data then facilitate the simulation of possible variations for ongoing optimization.
First, it is necessary to determine which choice of data is significant and actually needed for evaluating the day-to-day status in bridge construction progress. Secondly, the required data must be captured as efficiently as possible during the ongoing working activities.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/301.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Advanced Simulation of Tower Crane Operation utilizing System Dynamics Modeling and Lean Principles</i><br />Shafiul Hasan and Mohamed Al-Hussein (University of Alberta) and Patrick Gillis (GG Crane Group)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_616_964" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_616_964').hide();

Wind farms are typically constructed in undeveloped rural areas with challenging topography.  The lack of a paved road network leading to the site and within the site itself pose significant challenges to the planning of wind farm construction. Therefore the selection of the most appropriate access road route is essential in the overall planning of the wind farm construction. This paper presents an overall view of the construction process and will focus on the selection of access road routes to optimize the overall wind farm construction. An integrated framework for wind farm construction is presented and the problem of optimal access road selection is highlighted. A discrete event simulation model is developed for the site construction and the model is used to test the impact of various access road routes on the overall duration of the project.

To be effective, the incentive amount should be larger than the contractor’s additional cost (CAC) for expediting construction time. Yet, estimating the CAC poses a major challenge because contractors are reluctant to disclose their profit information. This study introduces a quantitative model that estimates realistic CACs through schedule simulations on four different resource usage levels. An innovative and reliable tool called Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies (CA4PRS) was used for the simulation. Using CA4PRS, a set of contractors’ time-cost tradeoff data was created and a linear regression analysis was performed to predict the CAC growth rate and to analyze how this interacts with the agency’s specified schedule goal. The robustness of the proposed model was also validated through a case study. This model can assist decision-makers to make better decisions when estimating optimal incentive amounts.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/305.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="15 // SCHEDULING APPLICATIONS"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">SCHEDULING APPLICATIONS</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 1:30 P.M. - 3:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Resource Allocation</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Archis Ghate (University of Washington)<br /></span><br /><i>Using Simulation-Based Stochastic Approximation to Optimize Staffing of Systems with Skills-Based-Routing</i><br />Zohar Feldman (IBM) and Avishai Mandelbaum (Israel Institute of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_624_4293" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_624_4293').hide();

consider, each server skill is associated with a corresponding cost, and service level can either appear as a strong

The solution we propose is based on the Stochastic Approximation (SA) approach. Since SBR models are analytically
intractable in general, we use computer simulation to evaluate service-level measures. Under the assumption of
convexity of the service-level as functions in staffing levels, SA provides an analytical proof of convergence, together
with a rate of convergence. We show, via numerical examples, that although the convexity assumption does not

This paper examines an appointment scheduling problem for an outpatient unit where multiple doctors practice independently yet sharing common resources. An ophthalmology department of a large-scale general hospital in Korea is modeled in discrete event simulation. Our experimental results show that under multiple-doctor and resource-sharing environment, collection of the seemingly optimal appointment rules for individual doctors does not lead to optimal performance for the system.

Jobs have geometric service durations, demand resources, incur a holding cost while waiting in queue, a penalty cost of rejection when the queue is filled to capacity, and generate a reward on completion. The goal is to select which jobs to service in each time-period so as to maximize total infinite-horizon discounted expected profit. We present Markov Decision Process (MDP) models of these problems and apply a Lagrangian relaxation-based method that exploits the structure of the MDP models to approximate their optimal value functions. We then develop a dynamic programming technique to efficiently recover
resource allocation decisions from this approximate value function on the fly. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these decisions outperform well-known heuristics by at least 35% but as much as 220% on an average.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/308.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 3:30 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Enterprise Scheduling</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Luis Rabelo (University of Central Florida)<br /></span><br /><i>An Architecture for Simulation-Based Performance Assessment of Planning Approaches in Semiconductor Manufacturing</i><br />Thomas Ponsignon (Infineon Technologies AG) and Lars Moench (University of Hagen)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_630_5893" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_630_5893').hide();

In this paper, we introduce a simulation-based architecture dedicated to performance assessment that has been initially designed for pure production control schemes and finally extended to planning algorithms. After the description of the framework and its implementation, the performance of two mid-term planning approaches is assessed with the help of the proposed architecture. The planning performance is evaluated by means of a stability measure in a rolling horizon environment.

Recent developments have made DES models feasible for use in the day-to-day operational production and planning of manufacturing facilities. Operative simulation models provide manufacturers with the ability to evaluate the capacity of the system for new orders, unforeseen events such as equipment downtime, and changes in operations. A simulation-based Decision Support System (DSS) can be used to help planners and schedulers organize production more efficiently in the turbulent global manufacturing. This paper presents the challenges for development and the efforts to overcome these challenges for the simulation-based DSS. The major challenges are: 1) data integration 2) automated simulation model creation and updates and 3) the visualization of results for interactive and effective decision making.

Companies acting in a fast and complex world. Currently available scheduling and rescheduling mechanisms are lacking of solution quality or need to much calculation time. Therefore, new self-adapting systems, that are able to generate good solutions quickly and refine itself over time are needed. A new approach for a simulation based adaption mechanism for a knowledge based system is presented in this paper. Adaption of the knowledge based and the used classifier is supported by the mechanism. It is shown, that the solution quality increases when using the adaption mechanism instead of the native system without adaption component.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/312.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><i>Modeling and Simulation of Container Terminal Logistics Systems Using Harvard Architecture and Agent-Based Computing</i><br />Bin Li (Fujian University of Technology) and Wen-feng Li (Wuhan University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_638_2527" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_638_2527').hide();

To strive towards these objectives, discrete event simulation (DES) has proven to be an effective tool for production system decision support. Large companies continuously log raw data, and are therefore able to collect large quantities of re-source event information. However, usually it is difficult to reuse data for future DES projects. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe how to facilitate data sharing between data sources and DES models. A test implementation of a simulation data architecture has been realized. A data processing tool, a database and an interface were created, which provide reusable resource event data to pave the way for sustainable resource information in DES projects. The entirety data exchange is provided by standard XML documents following the latest Core Manufacturing Simulation Data recommendations.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/317.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="16 // HOMELAND SECURITY"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">HOMELAND SECURITY</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Wednesday 8:30 A.M. - 10:00 A.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Security and Simulation Modeling</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Young Lee (IBM Research)<br /></span><br /><i>Simulation-Based Manpower Planning With Optimized Scheduling In A Distributed Multi-User Enviroment</i><br />David Kalasky (IBM), Michael Coffmann (Transportation Security Administration), Melanie DeGrano (IBM) and Kevin Field (ProModel Corporation)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_646_7422" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_646_7422').hide();

The objectives of the effort were to replace the GPSS simulation engine, optimizer and user-interface (UI) to take advantage of more robust, higher perform-ance network-based systems technologies. The previous system was distributed to the 200+ users as a stand alone application. This presented maintenance, security and performance issues, especially during the annual budgeting process. This paper focuses on the creation and integration of the simulation engine which was required to replicate and improve on the existing GPSS model accuracy and performance.

A base model for background traffic was constructed and validated in order to represent real traffic conditions. Six evacuation scenarios were developed and explored within simulation experiments by varying factors involving the occupancy rate of parking lots and background traffic levels.

Local impacts are expressed in terms of the number of assets (under various equipment categories) most likely to be damaged. The total megawatt equivalent of damage-prone power plants is assessed, as is an estimate of power flows that could be disrupted. Damage functions and fragility curves are employed to identify specific electric assets that could be affected. The potential of large-scale electric system collapse is explored via a series of network simulations. The methodology employs two models, the FEMA-developed HAZUS MH-MR3 and Argonne-developed EPfast tool for simulating uncontrolled islanding in electric systems. The models are described, and their complementary roles are discussed.</div><br /><a href="http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc10papers/321.pdf" target="_blank">Full Paper</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="18 // TITAN TALKS"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">TITAN TALKS</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Monday 12:20 P.M. - 1:20 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">TITANS I</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Enver Yucesan (INSEAD)<br /></span><br /><i>Applying Advanced Simulation Methodologies to Supercomputer Design: A “Pure” Operations Researcher’s Downward Path</i><br />Philip Heidelberger (IBM)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_658_3186" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_658_3186').hide();

Blue Gene supercomputers are low power and massively parallel, with up to 100,000 nodes.  Each node is a system-on-a-chip consisting of multiple low power processor cores, multiple levels of cache memory, interconnection networks and network interface logic, all integrated onto a single chip. This level of integration enhances reliability and permits a high level of compute density with 1024 nodes in a rack.  

To architect the network, a near cycle accurate parallel discrete event simulation model of the network was developed and used in a production manner.  For a full-sized system, the model can be viewed as a queuing network with over six million resources.  Because of the scale of the network, and the large memory footprint implied by such a model, parallel simulation is the only practical approach for conducting meaningful performance studies.  The talk describes the simulator, gives several performance tradeoff examples and describes validation against measurements on the real hardware.    

Concepts from rare event simulation estimation were also used in the logic verification of the network, i.e., in verifying that the hardware logic always performs correctly.  In rare event simulation an importance sampling distribution is selected to move the simulation towards the rare event of interest and the output is multiplied by a likelihood ratio in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the probability of the rare event.  In logic simulation there are a multitude of rare events or “corners”, many of which are unknown a priori, and the goal is to reach all of them.  No likelihood ratio is required, but the analog of appropriate importance sampling distributions need to be selected so as to reach all the corners.  The challenges and approaches to designing effective logic verification simulations will be described.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Tuesday 12:20 P.M. - 1:20 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">TITANS II</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Enver Yucesan (INSEAD)<br /></span><br /><i>From Back of the Envelope to Large-scale Simulation: Public Policy Evaluation and Support in Complex Domains</i><br />Paul Kleindorfer (INSEAD)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_660_9471" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_660_9471').hide();

The use of large-scale simulation typically occurs in contexts where fundamental changes are regarded as required, but where the irreversibility of policy moves or the complexity of the interacting organizational and economic drivers make ex ante evaluation of alternatives a prudent necessity.  I will first discuss three case examples I have been involved with in the past decade to illustrate the challenges.  These case studies come from the market opening of postal and delivery markets in the European Union (EU), designing risk transfer instruments for catastrophe risks from natural hazards in global risk markets, and conversion of commercial fleets to electric and hybrid vehicles as part of current moves to develop sustainable transportation models with low-carbon emissions.  

I will use these examples to highlight several crucial themes now emerging in the design and validation of large-scale simulation models when these models are used in support of public policy.  The crucial themes include integrating validation across multiple stakeholders (the EU postal market required integration across representatives from all 27 EU Member States); legitimation in the face of epistemic/knowledge risks (typical in catastrophe models for climate change risks); and enabling collaborative risk sharing in complex environments (for conversion to low-carbon fleet operations, the required collaboration is between fleet operators, the government, electricity suppliers and auto makers).

These case studies reflect the important contributions simulation has been making to the policy arena over the past several decades.  They also highlight the ever present problems of legitimation and validation that are important for all simulation studies, but that take on a special character when these intersect with public policy choices.  Research challenges for the simulation community involved in public policy analysis and support will conclude my talk.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="centered">[ <a href="#top">Return to Top</a> ]</div><hr /><br /><br /><div class="centered"><a name="19 // PHD COLLOQUIUM"></a><b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: gray">PHD COLLOQUIUM</b><br /><br /></div><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Sunday 1:00 P.M. - 2:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">PhD Colloquium Keynote</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Margaret Loper (Georgia Tech Research Institute)<br /></span><br /><i>Life After the PhD: What I Wish I had Known Sooner</i><br />Leon F.

In recent years, many new designs have been created to address the large number of factors and complex response surfaces that often arise in simulation studies, but handling discrete-valued or qualitative factors remains problematic.
We develop a mixed integer programming framework that, given a limited number of design points (dp), generates a design which is almost orthogonal and also almost balanced. The approach works for any mix of factor types (categorical, continuous and discrete) and accommodates factors with differing numbers of levels. The resulting designs have high D-optimality values and low maximum absolute pairwise correlations. We constructed a 512-dp design suitable for experiments involving up to 100 continuous factors and 20 k-level factors for each of k=2,…,11. This flexible design has already been used to investigate several large-scale simulation models of real-world problems.</div><br /><br /><i>Control Variates for Sensitivity Estimation</i><br />Na Sun (Boston University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_666_3195" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_666_3195').hide();

We show that estimators based on pathwise and likelihood ratio methods can be cast in a general setting where generic control variates can be systematically defined for their estimation.  In general, the means of such controls cannot be exactly calculated. One can use the Biased or Estimated Control Variates approach and estimate the means via simulation, or use the approach of DataBase Monte Carlo (DBMC) which also requires estimation of control means via simulation.   We consider a parametric setting where price sensitivities need to be estimated repeatedly at multiple parameters.  The fact that the same controls can be used for multiple estimation problems can justify the setup cost.  The approach is illustrated via simple examples and preliminary computational results are provided.</div><br /><br /><i>Importance Sampling for Parametric Estimation</i><br />Xiaojin Tang (Boston University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_668_1981" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_668_1981').hide();

We have used DBMC along with the variance reduction techniques of stratification and control variates.

ers high business value concerning great concern in industry. In such context, both functional and non-functional behavior of systems have to be assured, e.g., Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of tasks has to be known. However, due to high complexity of such systems and the nature of the problem, the exact WCRT of tasks is impossible to find in practice, but can only be bounded. In this thesis, we address this challenge by presenting a simulation framework for approximate timing analysis of CRTES, namely AESIR-CORES, which uses three novel contributions. Our evaluation using three models inspired by two fictive but representative industrial CRTES indicates that AESIR-CORES can either successfully obtain the actual WCRT values, or have the potential to bound the unknown actual WCRT values from a statistical perspective.</div><br /><br /><i>Model-based Evolutionary Optimization</i><br />Yongqiang Wang (University of Maryland)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_672_6960" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_672_6960').hide();

If zones are independently managed, there is no coordination among providers. This causes the overall system to be quite inefficient, due to a large amount of empty trip miles driven, a major cause for these services’ high operating costs. Coordination among providers is possible by including transfer points at zone boundaries and can potentially improve productivity. The zoning with transfer practice has been adopted by some transit agencies (Chicago, Boston and San Diego, for example) but never properly investigated from a research point of view. This research study evaluates the impact of transfer design on decentralized zoning paratransit through extensive simulation analyses and related sensitivity analyses to evaluate the interaction among geographic boundaries, size of service area, demand distribution and number of transfer points.</div><br /><br /><i>Bi-Criteria Analysis of Ambulance Diversion Policies</i><br />Adrian Ramirez (Arizona State University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_680_3299" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_680_3299').hide();

This paper develops a simulation model for ED to study the impact of AD policies based on one of the following main ED state variables: the number of patients waiting, the number of patients boarding and the number of available beds in the inpatient unit. The objective is to analyze the impact of AD on the ED performance considering two criteria: patient average waiting time and percentage of time spent on diversion. Results show that there exist significant differences based on the variables chosen to design the policy. This insight can assist to ED managers in making AD decisions to achieve better quality of healthcare service.</div><br /><br /><i>Simulating the Influence of a 45% Increase in Patient Volume on the Emergency Department of Akershus University Hospital</i><br />Lene Berge Holm (Akershus University Hospital)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_682_3200" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_682_3200').hide();

This work introduces a policy optimization procedure for the continuous review (r,Q) inventory system having a ready rate service level constraint. Two types of SAA optimization procedures are constructed based on sampling from two different simulation methods: 1) discrete event simulation: net inventory values are sampled from an empirical cumulative distribution which is built through a single simulation run of the underlying inventory system and 2) Monte-Carlo simulation: lead-time demands are sampled by performing l-fold convolution of randomly generated demand values. The efficiency of each sampling method is evaluated through a set of experiments under different demand processes. In addition, the applicability of the proposed optimization procedure to the other service levels and other re-order type inventory systems is discussed.</div><br /><br /><i>Modeling Parameter Uncertainty in Stochastic Simulations with Correlated Inputs</i><br />Canan Gunes (Carnegie Mellon University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_686_7068" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_686_7068').hide();

This research highlights the application of the lean principles to manual assembly processes, where the operator characteristics are considered as deterministic of operator schedule. In this study, a manual circuit breaker assembly line is examined, where operator skill levels, attention spans, classified as reliability measures considered to select the most suitable resource allocation and break schedules. The effect of operator attributes on the process is modeled and simulated using Arena, followed by a hierarchical preference aggregation technique as the decision making tool.

The paper discusses a problem faced by a make-to-order (MTO) firm that has the ability to reject or accept the order and set prices and lead-times to influence demands. The inventory holding costs, lateness tardiness costs, order rejection cost, manufacturing variable costs and fixed costs are considered. The firm is confronted with the problem of order selection and tradeoff price, lead-time and potential for increased demand against capacity constraints, in order to maximize the expected profits in an infinite planning horizon with stochastic demands.
We model the problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Problem (SMDP) and develop a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. In addition, we develop a discrete-event simulation model to validate the performance of the algorithm and compare the experimental results with two benchmarking policies, the First-Come-First-Serve policy and a threshold heuristic. It is shown that RL algorithm outperforms two benchmarking policies in the five scenarios.</div><br /><br /><i>Warranty Servicing with a Brown-Proschan Repair Option</i><br />Rudrani Banerjee (New Jersey Institute of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_692_4940" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_692_4940').hide();

Influence diagrams (IDs) are used as MIMO simulation metamodels enabling the solution of multi-objective optimization and decision making problems without limitations to the probability distributions involved. They also warrant the study of the time evolution of simulation following each decision alternative. For sensitivity analysis, variables representing the simulation parameters can be included in both DBNs and IDs. Game theoretic metamodels are applied for simulation-optimization in game settings with several decision makers pursuing their own objectives.

From the literature of ontological representations of systems, we find that a system consists of three classes of elements - namely objects, processes and the relationships between them.  Current practices of conceptual modeling treat the process element as an indicator of a change of state to some object and therefore only cope with a limited subset of process modeling.  Functional decomposition of the three ontological elements and their possible arrangements, backed up by literature review, has identified a number of additional aspects that are crucial to the accurate modeling of a process.  These aspects are presented as a series of requirements that can be used to enhance current modeling practices, or to guide the development of future modeling practices that are more disposed towards ontological process representation.</div><br /><br /><i>Proposed Visual Wiki System for Gathering Knowledge about Discrete Event Systems</i><br />Peter Dungan (University of Limerick)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_698_8545" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_698_8545').hide();

Another issue is the potential benefit offered by the recording of the gathered knowledge, in a way that facilitates its reuse outside of the modeling project itself. Existing approaches to the construction of a system description have different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore a combination of different model types, in an integrated manner, could be most effective. Visual wiki software is proposed to facilitate this.

They are generally text-based; a wiki allowing editing of graphics as well as text would be preferable for system and process knowledge.</div><br /><br /><i>An Integrated Framework for Construction Project Information Management</i><br />Elmira Moghani (University of Alberta)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_700_6422" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_700_6422').hide();

The main contribution of this research is the development of a generic framework that can dynamically capture, store, process, and access all project information, from the planning stage through the construction process to the completed project including all changes. This framework employs a distributed simulation concept based on the High Level Architecture (HLA) rules to standardize the integration process and to support interoperability, reusability, and extensibility of the framework.

Performance disparities were found to correspond to differences in the materials used for the termination and to capacitor size. Distinct performance correlations were discerned in preliminary studies varying termination material and capacitor dimensions. Flexible termination capacitors were shown to exhibit a tolerance for higher board bending loads with low strain rates but not for bending at higher strain rates. Under regimes in which boards were subjected to cyclic bending, vibrations, temperature cycling, and high-g loading, a pattern was detected in which cracks tended to emerge in the capacitor’s ceramic body on the bottom portion close to the termination.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Sunday 5:00 P.M. - 7:00 P.M.</b><br /><b style="font-size: 1.2em">PhD Colloquium Posters</b><br /><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Chair: Margaret Loper (Georgia Tech Research Institute)<br /></span><br /><i>Simulating the Effects of Prehistoric Migration Events on Body Dimensions among Oceanic Populations</i><br />Benjamin Davies (The University of Auckland)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_704_6290" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_704_6290').hide();

Presumed founding populations varied within and among themselves in body size. But judging from available evidence, none were, on average, as tall or as broad as virtually any of the peoples found in Remote Oceania today. While this difference has been attributed to genetic bottlenecking from serial migration events, it remains a largely untested hypothesis. We simulated the migration of groups with body size distributions plausible for founding peoples, taking care to maintain intra-individual correlations among height, biacromial, and biiliac breadths. Serial bottlenecking alone was found to be very unlikely as an explanation.

Our theory extends to multiple stochastic constraints under certain restrictions on extreme dependence between the functions involved in the framework. Ongoing and future work includes the construction of consistent estimators towards an implementable sampling algorithm and Lagrangian extensions that incorporate the constraints within a revised objective function.</div><br /><br /><i>DEVS Multilayered Modeling and Simulation</i><br />Emilie Broutin (University of Corsica)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_718_1674" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_718_1674').hide();

In my ongoing PhD-Thesis I focus on an approach called Model Predictive Control (MPC) to counter the growing uncertainties in modern manufacturing systems, which utilize a symbiotic simulation system to predict the advantage for a set of given control alternatives by using the attached simulation system. In theory, MPC is able to find an optimal control vector, which fits the current state, target function an constrains. Practical, the problem complexity and time constrains limits the amount of evaluated control vectors in a significant degree, that a full enumeration is impossible, even with massive parallelism. For that reason, I intend to establish a well-directed experimentation control, based on optimization and agent technologies, which reduces the amount of evaluated control vectors while maintaining a near-optimal characteristic.</div><br /><br /><i>Kriging Metamodeling in Simulation Optimization</i><br />Mehdi Zakerifar (University of Louisville)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_722_2820" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_722_2820').hide();

The optimization approaches described here have the objective of finding  optimal values of reorder point, s, and maximum inventory level, S, so as to minimize the total cost of the inventory system while maximizing customer satisfaction.

The responsiveness of a porter system directly affects the utilization of expensive assets (such as X-ray and MRI) and the efficiency of clinical staff (such as nurses and techs).  Poor responsiveness results in idle time for waiting assets and causes clinical staff to be pulled away from direct patient care by having to assume the transportation responsibilities.  Hospital transports are characterized by a mix of random and scheduled demands and by highly variable service times.  In this work, we simulate the cost and responsiveness of an existing decentralized transport system and compare it to a proposed centralized (pooled server) system.  We also determine the minimal staffing profile by hour of day needed to provide a target service level.

It is based on embedding online simulations into a sensor network and adding communication and synchronization among the simulators. The key feature of online simulations is to effectively project future system states by utilizing the field data to calibrate the simulations. Embedding online simulations into a sensor network offers the advantage that the simulations are closer to the data, lessening the need to aggregate the data to reduce the communication bandwidth requirements. More advantages include scalability, failure resiliency, etc. While prior work focused on the ad hoc approach in the context of online management of transportation systems, our work investigates the applicability of this approach in systems that can be modeled as networks of queues. Our initial results show that the ad hoc queueing network simulation can provide predictions comparable to sequential simulations.</div><br /><br /><i>Exploring the Impact of Socio-Technical Communication Styles on the Resilience and Innovation Capacity of Global Participatory Science</i><br />Ozgur Ozmen (Auburn University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_732_1483" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_732_1483').hide();

In this work, we present a constrained hierarchical technique for making a virtual world scalable and using a decentralised conservative synchronisation approach for making it consistent. Using splitting, merging, and intelligent assignment strategies, we dynamically assign resources based on load, thus minimising resource utilisation. It also reduces levels in the resource management tree, and communication overhead while increasing interactive user experience compared with traditional approaches. However, dependencies among different components of hierarchical models introduce longer delays, and are complex to implement and achieve a consistent view among different parts of a system. Exploiting a decentralised mechanism, we maintain a consistent view of a virtual world by restricting a server executing a region to synchronise itself with servers executing adjacent regions sharing physical boundaries with it. It maintains traditional constraints and significantly reduces communication overhead, complexity and delays.</div><br /><br /><i>Exploring The Foreclosure Contagion Effect Using Agent-Based Modeling</i><br />Andrew Collins, Marshall Gangel and Michael Seiler (Old Dominion University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_736_8395" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_736_8395').hide();

Especially if the construction project is very large and complex constraints must be taken into account, the definition of an nearly optimal schedule regarding different and partly contrary objectives is very time-consuming. However, to solve such NP-hard optimization problems well-known metaheuristic concepts are existing. In this paper, a simulation-based metaheuristic is presented that enables the determination of near-optimal schedules in a reasonable amount of time. The concept uses the well-known Simulated Annealing approach in combination with Pareto-optimality to consider different objectives. During the optimization process the schedules are determined using constraint-based simulation. The constraint-based simulation concept allows the efficient generation of valid solutions. The principles of the concept and some implementation details are highlighted. Finally, a case study, which covers the shell construction of a office building, demonstrates the effectiveness of the simulation-based optimization approach.</div><br /><br /><i>Simulating Mass Spectra: A Step Towards Analyzing Glycan Biosynthesis</i><br />Jun Han, John Miller and William York (University of Georgia)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_746_3143" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_746_3143').hide();

Successfully simulating the mass spectra of IDAWG(TM) experiments will help analyze and model glycan biosynthesis. In our work, the major issue is how to estimate the relative abundance levels of molecules involved in glycan biosynthesis, from experimental mass spectra collected from different time points. The proposed approach utilizes gradient search to minimize the difference between experimental and simulated spectra.

The layered architecture of the prototype system involving in human behavior in crisis situations is explained in detail. The model holds different internal states of human beings. The internal state is composed of physical, emotional, and social aspects. The emotion contagion model decides the modeling solutions for common environmental, socio-psychological and behavioral phenomena in the context of crisis, defines their interrelation and impact on an individual’s internal state and integrates them into a comprehensive modeling approach. The LSCS prototype system platform can be used to analyze, forecast

This work introduces a policy optimization procedure for the continuous review (r,Q) inventory system having a ready rate service level constraint. Two types of SAA optimization procedures are constructed based on sampling from two different simulation methods: 1) discrete event simulation: net inventory values are sampled from an empirical cumulative distribution which is built through a single simulation run of the underlying inventory system, 2)Monte-Carlo simulation: lead-time demands are sampled by performing l-fold convolution of randomly generated demand values. The efficiency of each sampling method is evaluated through a set of experiments under different demand processes. In addition, the applicability of the proposed optimization procedure to the other service levels and other re-order type inventory systems is discussed.</div><br /><br /><i>The M&S Catalog</i><br />Brandi Greenberg (OSD CAPE (Alion)), Steve Hunt (OSD CAPE (SAIC)) and George Stone (OSD CAPE  (Alion))<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_760_1743" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_760_1743').hide();

This model has been updated to include, as a novel feature, use of terrain elevation data to correct impact points and exposure to fragments. Blast damage is also included.  The target is represented by vulnerable areas from different aspects and an overall height and damage is considered using fragment penetration equations. The model is computationally efficient, due to adaptive integration and since it only considers the area around the targets from which fragments can affect. Furthermore, the model can be used to compute input data for simpler models.

However, due to high complexity of such systems and the nature of the problem, the exact WCRT of tasks is impossible to find in practice, but can only be bounded. In this thesis, we address this challenge by presenting a simulation framework for approximate timing analysis of CRTES, namely AESIR-CORES, which uses three novel contributions. Our evaluation using three models inspired by two fictive but representative industrial CRTES indicates that AESIR-CORES can either successfully obtain the actual WCRT values, or have the potential to bound the unknown actual WCRT values from a statistical perspective.</div><br /><br /><i>Automatic Generation of Adaptive Simulation Models for Production</i><br />Soeren Bergmann (Ilmenau University of Technology)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_774_7155" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_774_7155').hide();

Inherited geometric properties, namely the convex hull and variation diminishing properties support an intelligent nonlinear optimization algorithm that can intelligently select optimization start points from the underlying structure of the metamodel, and based on the results of subsequent optimization runs, eliminate regions and potential starting points from further consideration. As a consequence, the optimal solution to the metamodel is known and definable bounds on optimization costs for the metamodel. These nested approximations enable significant advantages for the solution of optimization problems, including nonlinear, mixed integer and multi-objective optimization problems. In particular, recent work has established a link between graph optimization algorithms and robust optimization problems represented with NURBs-based metamodels.</div><br /><br /><i>The Problem of Efficient Blood Transfusion</i><br />Esra Aleisa (Kuwait University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_782_2013" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_782_2013').hide();

Blood is typically withdrawn, tested, stored, and shipped by localized blood centers where the goal is to reduce shortage and waste and ultimately rescue more lives.  Technically, the problem of blood transfusion can be perceived as a supply chain between blood donors and recipients with a type of inventory goods that are highly perishable.  In addition, this problem is also subject to a random supply and demand.  Other blood characteristics such as cross-matching of different blood types also contribute to the complexity of the problem.  Due to these considerations, researchers often resolute to simulation to develop scenarios to improve the blood supply and distribution systems.  This research surveys the literature for efficient blood transfusion models in an attempt to identify the critical factors that contribute to a better utilization of donor’s blood.</div><br /><br /><i>Architecture Design and Implementation of a prototypical ICSS for SBA</i><br />Hwang Ho Kim and Hee Chul Shin (Ajou University)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_784_4225" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_784_4225').hide();

Our team performed network and application data captures of the system for a local user in a development environment, then used the OPNET suite of tools and Shunra's WAN emulation appliance to simulate the performance improvement for the remote users. We quantified how reducing the number of application request-response sequences greatly decreases the multiplicative effect of latency. We also showed that using a specific image compression technique improves the overall performance for local and remote users.

Usually hierarchical clustering is applied to allow for a multi-level visualization, and in this way for a visual exploration of such data sets at multiple levels of granularity. Different distance measures can be used to define the cluster hierarchy, but in any case the distance values are estimated based on the data values, rather than on sets of values representing, e.g. temporal trends. This poster  presents a new approach for defining and visualizing the cluster hierarchy. For this purpose, we introduce a similarity measure to cluster elements by their temporal trends. Our visualization approach shows both; the hierarchy and the clusters represented by characteristic data values and their quality over time. This allows for effectively exploring  different clusters and data values as well as to identify interesting data and trends.</div><br /><br /><i>Use of the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm in the Calibration of a Patient Level Simulation of Prostate Cancer Screening</i><br />Jim Chilcott, Matthew Mildred and Silvia Hummel (University of Sheffield)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_790_9521" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_790_9521').hide();

Many of these aspects of the decision problem are unobservable and data can only tell us about their joint uncertainty. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was used to calibrate a patient level simulation model of the natural history of prostate cancer to national cancer registry and international trial data. This method correctly represents the joint uncertainty amongst the model parameters by drawing efficiently from a high dimensional correlated parameter space. The calibration approach estimates the probability of developing prostate cancer, the rate of disease progression and sensitivity of the screening test. This is then used to estimate the impact of prostate cancer screening in the UK. This case study demonstrates that the Metropolis-Hastings approach to calibration can be used to appropriately characterise the uncertainty alongside computationally expensive simulation models.</div><br /><br /><i>Utilizing Simulation Modeling to Identify Manpower Needs at a Fortune 100 Company</i><br />Tricia L.

This case study investigates two methods for reducing dimensions in multivariate data generated from simulations. One method combines correlation analysis and clustering. The second method uses principal components analysis. We apply both methods to reduce a 22-dimensional data set generated by a network simulator. We identify issues that an analyst must decide, and we compare the reductions suggested by the methods.

The hospital’s Research Department has previously conducted two simulation studies for Ahus; one for the ER-unit, and another for the hospital as a whole. The success of these projects prompted the Surgical Department (SD) to commission a two-component study: first develop a high-resolution single-procedure (HRSP)DES-model for identifying delaying factors during a single surgery. In particular, the chief-of-surgery wishes to visualize for the staff how sensitive throughput-rates are to the availability of certain (shared) resources (e.g. one anaesthesiologist serves two operating theatres simultaneously). The goal is to analyze the feasibility of maintaining satisfactory quality-of-care and throughput-rates without additional operating theatres. Experiences from the HRSPDES-model will ideally facilitate both necessary OR-scheduling and endorsement from the staff for proposed efficiency-improving measures.</div><br /><br /><i>Modeling Operating Room Workload of Wounded Warriors and Other Case Types During Capital Region Construction</i><br />Martin Miller (Northern Lights, Inc.)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_814_6034" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_814_6034').hide();

Hotel Space is designed to accommodate short stay for (a) surgical and interventional radiology patients completing prep and recovery and (b) observation patients. Process simulation modeling is used because of large amount of data and variability, including flexibility to perform variety of scenario analysis. Space usage optimization identifies best room assignment configurations that minimize patient waiting times while maximizing space utilization.

The model is developed in Arena simulation software.  Patient arrival volumes are differentiated by time of the day and day of the week because of different surgery and procedure types, and operating room schedules.

The first routine utilizes a systematic process of elimination to maximize (or minimize) outcomes subject to attribute constraints.  The second routine uses a search and mutate approach to minimize medical kit attributes given a set of outcome constraints.

For this analysis, IMM predictions were compared to data from historical shuttle missions, not yet included as model source input.  Initial goodness of fit testing on International Space Station data suggests that the IMM may overestimate the number of occurrences for three of the 83 medical conditions in the model.  The IMM did not underestimate the occurrence of any medical condition.  Initial comparisons with shuttle data demonstrate the importance of understanding crew preference (i.e., preferred analgesic) for accurately predicting the utilization of resources.

The study shows that a simulation model can be used, even for people without simulation background, to develop and implement small step-by-step improvements, which lead toward global, significant network improvement.  Due to the mentioned users’ background, the designed model also is complemented with two graphical user interfaces (GUI) that help people without simulation knowledge test model scenarios and visualize the ensuing results.</div><br /><br /><i>Simulating Large-Scale Traffic Flow in Tokyo Metropolitan Area with Millions of Driver Agents</i><br />Sei Kato (IBM)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_824_9207" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_824_9207').hide();

Simulated traffic volume was compared with observations of traffic volume. The results indicate that, as we simulate wider area, the simulator exhibits good reproducibility, meaning that our approach to simulate large-scale traffic flow in microscopic is sound to simulate traffic situation in wide area. We conducted this large-scale traffic flow simulation by improving the performance of a path search module of the IBM Mega Traffic Simulator.

This method requires a longer lead time to SORP (Start Of Regular Production) and incurs extra expense. Ideally, there should be a complete system validation in an emulated environment; however, due to the limitations in the true-to-life emulation technology and time/cost restraints, the current pure emulation of the automation system is limited to the system demonstration by the sales department.  In this case study we demonstrate three different scenarios in which a simulation or emulation might be integrated into an existing manufacturing automation system for validation.  The solutions include adding an emulated cell to the existing system, replacing an existing cell with an emulated cell, and replacing a real robot with a simulated robot.  In each scenario focus is put on the interface between simulation/emulation and the real process.</div><br /><br /><i>Simulation In Support of Manufacturing: The Benefits of Factory and Module Unique Simulation Applications in Intel Fab-28</i><br />Moti Klein (Intel Corporation)<br /><a class="clickable no-decoration" id="vhsjs_view_830_1656" onclick="$('#vhsjs_view_830_1656').hide();

Today it is apparent in F28 that the model will be used for a variety of CT related aspects and we wanted to share the success with other HVM semiconductor sites.
